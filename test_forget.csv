"This is supposed to be a non-smoking hotel, but they let guests smoke on the balconies. Second-hand smoke is sucked into the through-the-wall air conditioning units and  your room smells like smoke. There is nothing management can do except give you a free breakfast, if you complain. Sad.",0,negative
Be prepared for second hand smoke,0,negative
I had a non smoking floor yet we can smell the smoke in our room. Our clothes smell like it our hair. Shower was dirty. They didn't turn our phone on so I had to use my cell phone to call the front desk. I will not stay there again. I do like that it was across the street from a Thai place and a nice bar/lounge.,0,negative
"Skip this hotel.  Arrived to what I thougth was a spa room, except it was a smoking room.  What part of spa evokes smoking.  When I tried to move, they said they were sold out.  The operator offered me a 50 food credit which was something but really, a smoking room.  They did finally move me the next day but I'm still fried about the whole thing.  I found an actual cig lighter under the bed.  gross.  I will not be staying at this hotel again.",0,negative
Love this place. Only down side is its a little too smoky for my taste,1,positive
This place was empty came here twice. Mabe 2 groups at the most were in here. Ultra high prices Hookahs cost 20 to 30 dollars its nuts. They don't smoke that great and the guy working there was a little creepy he would pop up all over the place. The prices where just outrageous there's palace in summerlin that's way cheaper and nicer. I would npt recommend this place.,0,negative
"Smokers paradise!  It's a stink hole because of the \""""outside\"""" bar.  It's a joke, really.  I think the smoke-free laws are being violated here.  My family and I won't be back.\n\nWish I could give this cruddy place NO STARS.",0,negative
Sniff!  Cigarette smoke!\nThrill!  Gasp!  Electric fire!\nNouvel?  No!  Old-vel!,0,negative
I finally found a bar in my neighborhood with a patio for smokers and now they are closed. RIP,0,negative
What a shame that they permit smoking and ruined this casino.,0,negative
I originally booked my stay in Vegas here at Ballys.  After check in I went to the room and I couldn't believe the bad odor of cigarette smoke.  I called the frond desk and they seemed put out that I wanted a different room.  After waiting two hours I told them that I was canceling my stay and decided to go to a different hotel Casino.,0,negative
"the place smell so bad with smokers,we have to leave right away.",0,negative
"This place is great for those that just quit smoking... no, not really.. the cigar smell bleeds through these walls. the food is not that great.",0,negative
"Friendly staff, same starbucks fair you get anywhere else.  Sometimes the lines can get long.",1,positive
"The location is right on... across the street from UNCC and next store to Brueggers, I have spent many of nights cramming for a test or getting my caffeine fix before work. Since this Starbucks is very small and always busy you have to keep you eye on a table and pounce when one comes available. The baristas are my favorite in Charlotte, they have pretty much memorized my order. They're speedy and always friendly. Good thing Starbucks is building a larger location in the same shopping center.",1,positive
"Either they need to hire more baristas or they need to work in faster pace.  I ordered a very simple drink and waited for over 5 minutes for it.  It was also during evening rush hours, but that shouldn't be the reason why my drink took a long time to make.  Not impressed at all.",0,negative
"Went there after hearing about the Arizona Cardinals promotion, if the Cards won, you get a free medium coffee the day after the game.  Well, I went, didn't know about the app for the smart phone.  Was told that I need the app and the phone wasn't with me.   Didn't get the coffee, walked away unhappy.",0,negative
"The employees at this location always seem to have a latte up their a**. The few times that I have been here, I have felt that I'm bothering the employees and interrupting their conversations.",0,negative
"The staff is friendly and always serve me my coffee with a smile (and I go twice a day, too)! The drive-thru line in the morning is not the place for someone to be who is in a hurry, that's for sure. Nothing bad to say about the place or it's people at all! I am always a satisfied customer!",1,positive
"They destroy my drink 8/10 times and their baristas are quite rude. For one of the busiest Starbucks in Scottsdale, they lack quite a bit. I stopped coming to this Starbucks. I now go to the other one inside the store off the freeway.",0,negative
Pretty rude telling us to wait and then on top of it they do not accept the Starbucks cards here.  We walked out....too bad cuz we are gold card holders too.  Will not return to this location based on the rude service alone.  Across the street is a much friendlier location\n\nI am reviewing the Starbucks inside the Barnes and Noble.....terrible,0,negative
"Not the best Starbucks in the land. The people are friendly enough but they have made our drinks wrong on multiple occasions. Also, they get their deliveries through the front door and the shop is essentially a long hallway so if you are there in the evening, prepare to have lots of material rolling past you. One of the delivery men even dumped a few boxes on a customer last time I was there. They do have some nice outdoor seating with misters but it is right on the corner of a parking lot so it's usually loud.",0,negative
"I love the staff at this store. They are the reason I keep coming back.  This store is usually very busy - however the employees take the time to talk to you, get to know what's going on and really build a relationship with their customers.  \n\nAny Starbucks can make you a drink - this Starbucks is more about the experience.",1,positive
"I dread coming to this Starbucks. Have you ever walked into a place and felt totally uncomfortable? I get that feeling whenever I step into this Starbucks. Unless you walk here, forget finding a parking space. Carson street is very busy, and it's hard to park.",0,negative
"Well, it's a Starbucks...  Same coffee, same general atmosphere, but that is all that's good about this location.  It is about a third the size it needs to be, there is ALWAYS a waiting line and tables are overcrowded and sometimes hard to find.  Forget meeting with any privacy at all.  I felt like I was in the middle of three other conversations!\n\nI DO NOT recommend this location!",0,negative
"Incredible customer service.  They are very friendly and go out of their way to learn the names of all of their regular customers.\n\nThere is a good patio for sitting, which attracts a large crew of regulars who spend a good part of the morning there.\n\nA line does sometime form around 8-9 am, and I sometimes wonder why they don't do more to make sure during their super rush hours they aren't better staffed.\n\nOverall though, this is my favorite Starbucks.",1,positive
"While coffee is decent as Starbucks can be. The help has attitude. The place was burning up hot inside and when I asked if they had a/c I was told rudely by the barista \"""" I burn up every shift. \""""  putting a much more sour taste than the coffee in my mouth .",0,negative
"This place could be great if the service wasn't so rude. No one seems to care, and they never say thank you. Each time I've been here one of the little girls working at the counter has looked me up and down judgementally. \n\nThe coffee was fine, but the cookie I had was wayyy too sweet for me. \n\nIf you want to feel good about yourself, don't go here!",0,negative
Went here for breakfast one day. No issues with the food it was standard diner fare but the slow was not even the word for the service. Needless to say we wound up walking the few extra minutes to Starbucks every other morning for the remainder of the trip and grabbed breakfast there instead.,0,negative
"It is frezzing inside and the service is terrible,gave away our order to someone else and then said it would be another 15 min and when we said no they only gave us a partial refund and made us pay for the coffee even thoug we were leaving .they need a lesson in the customer is right",0,negative
The baristas were nice enough but the service was incredibly slow.  There was no line when I came in but apparently there were at least 2 or 3 orders ahead of me ... and they didn't start serving the first one ahead of me until 2 minutes of waiting.  I got the chocolate chip blended drink and it was really icy ... I've had the drink before and it's usually creamier.  Very disappointing.,0,negative
"Worst Starbucks I've ever been to! The staff is extremely rude and act like you are inconveniencing them. Also it's the SLOWEST!! It's a joke, every time I go it takes them nothing short of 30 mins in the drive thru line. I will usually drive out of my way to avoid this location.",0,negative
This location rocks. Consistently great service/coffee. This is not the closest Starbucks to my house but is officially my Starbucks. Whether I go in or order through the drive-through they give me my coffee fix. Great job!!!!,1,positive
"I pass 4 Starbucks to go to this one, I love the staff and the atmosphere. And it being next to Chipotle doesn't hurt either",1,positive
"Good, solid Starbucks location.  I have been here a handful of times.  They have been fast and get the orders right.  What else can you ask for?",1,positive
This Starbucks is the fanciest Starbucks I've ever been to! I believe they are owned by Barnes & Nobles and just serve Starbucks coffee. They have friendly service and have so many yummy pastries I've never seen at any other Starbucks like oreo cakes and quiches. They even carry cheesecake from The Cheesecake Factory! If you decide to eat there they serve your food on real plates with silverware! Even their Togo containers are nice! LOL,1,positive
Slowest Starbucks I've been to.... Unfortunate because this one is a convenient location to where I live but the drive through always takes 10-15 minutes whether there's 2 people in line or 12.  People very nice and friendly but not effect enough for how quick Starbucks is elsewhere,0,negative
"Great store, my home ... They are the best during the week in the AM. Their weekend team needs to learn from the A-Team but it's still better than some other stores. I mean it's Starbucks after all... Yeah I'll wait.",1,positive
Ranked 3 busiest Starbucks in AZ! Cut them some slack people!! Always busy all day! With some good customer service what else do you want?! Yes the only bad is they take pretty long for a drink when you go inside but drive thru is fast.,1,positive
"It's pretty straight forward. THEY ARE THE SLOWEST STARBUCKS ON THE PLANET!!  Good coffee as always, but it seems like a 20 min ordeal each time to get my iced coffee!!  PLEASE SPEED IT UP.",0,negative
"Here's the thing: I love Starbucks. I get at least 3 lattes everyday and use the Internet access. At this Starbucks the Internet wasn't working, the electrical outlets didn't work, and it was so dirty I didn't wanna sit down. I went to the starbucks down the street and was much happier.",0,negative
The coffee is great ...\nThe staff is really hurtful... I mean i told him i wanted two ice coffees... And he gave me two hot coffees .. So i said he was wrong  and that guy with the mustach started to curse me (in intalian i guess) REAALLLY??!\nI should have give them 5stars if the staff were really really nicer ...,0,negative
Say goodbye to starbucks and hello to an American favorite revived. Dunkin donuts has so much more to offer these days.  I enjoyed Barista style coffee with one of the best bagel and cream cheese I've had in a long time. The staff was awesome and the shop clean. I will be back.,1,positive
"Horrible customer service,  cashier must have had a bad day. Talked ugly to customers.   Not returning to this Starbucks.   First time I had service like this.",0,negative
"Good service but something is missing here, it seems like the workers are really unhappy here, and I understand that there's extra charges for wanting almond milk but geez, for a small matcha tea with almond milk is like $5.50... I can't get this kind of matcha latte anywhere else so I'm willing to pay that much, but I walk away upset at myself every single time lol...\nNo complaints about this location other than the droopy employees!",1,positive
"Service is slow, drinks are nothing to write home about.  I wanted this place to be so much more but it fell short.  \n\nI always want to try to try out coffee and drinks from other locations besides Starbucks, but it seems this place is just missing the mark.",0,negative
"This Starbucks location is staffed by great employees.  The review is because we have gotten such friendly service on a consistent basis.  My husband and I are usually stopping here on the weekends after dinner.  Even if we are coming in pretty late, we are always greeted with a smile and get a great beverage.  This location's manager is doing a great job with the store and her staff!",1,positive
"Friendly service, clean environment. Took 23 minutes for me to get a latte. Coffee was just okay...",0,negative
"Worst customer service!  They close their doors before 9, and I was in once and they asked someone to leave because they were closed and it was 4 min till 9!  Refused to refill a kids drink...even tho they have before and ALL other Starbucks have done so!  Worst manager in evenings!  Also, they said they couldn't do a pour over of Sumatra for me...they could only do what was brewing!  Don't waste your time...go to starbucks at Indian bend and scottsdale road!",0,negative
Terrible service! The cashier was rude and not as friendly as other Starbucks employees. My drink was completely forgotten about; I had to go up and remind them after 30 minutes of waiting. These girls need to be retrained.,0,negative
"Always slow. The cream is always empty. Believe it or not, they have run out of Pike more than a few times! How does a coffee place run out of coffee? I drive an extra 3 miles to avoid this place.",0,negative
By far the slowest Starbucks. ... 15 min for a cup of coffee after ordering. .. really?,0,negative
"By far the slowest Starbucks ever. The drive through is unbelievable! Nice people just amazingly slow. The one on Maryland and Silverado Ranch is quick and although it doesn't have a drive through and  is out of my way to work, it's faster to go in there than wait here!",0,negative
"I dislike this specific Starbucks a lot, my drink is always made wrong. Staff Is awesome but drinks wise, not the best.",0,negative
"I was pretty disappointed for a Las Vegas Starbucks to be so behind on the standard of the Starbucks trademark. They didn't have the drinks for the \""""rewards secret menu\"""", didn't have a rewards scanner, and didn't offer the'short' size option. And everything was overpriced... But the coffee still hit the spot.",0,negative
"Normal Starbuck's store.  The barista was efficient, the order was taken promptly, and the wifi for my iPhone was quite convenient after being in a back country area where there was no coverage.",1,positive
"I'm a Starbucks freak, however had had horrible experiences at some locations. But this location is great. I would stop in on the way to church or work. The drive they is always quick and they have never messed up an order. Recently the price they have me for my drink was high, so I questioned them about it. For the inconvenience they gave me my drink for free! Great customer service and the baristas are down to earth! Try this Starbucks out!",1,positive
Very understaffed. Long lines. And the pastries and drinks are way overpriced. $3.50 for a small cup of regular Joe. They do take Starbucks card now.,0,negative
"This Starbucks has a huge sign stating it now serves breakfast. After waiting in line for 10 minutes on 2 occasions, I was told \""""the delivery didn't arrive\"""". They simply advertise something they never have.....",0,negative
"We stopped by here for our breakfast, luckily we had Starbucks at hand. My coffee really got me through that thing. I'm pretty sure my Cinnabon wasn't finished baking, but they still served it. Honestly, I probably should have picked up breakfast while at Starbucks.",0,negative
This is the slowest starbucks ever. The drive thru takes forever. It seriously makes me late to work almost all the time. It is the closest to me but I don't think I can even come here anymore. They need to do something about the drive thru!!,0,negative
"Went to grab a late night cup of coffee at this 24-7 spot.  The coffee is great but the service was bitchy. She really thought her coffee grounds didn't stink and seemed annoyed at our arrival. The place was thrown together in a quant old bungalow style home which has character,  but ultimately lacked class in the staff,  which is what would make a difference.  Next time I'll go somewhere else because service is half of it!",0,negative
I love this Starbucks for its convenience. It's right next to the 95 for my commute to Hendertucky and the drive thru is not ever that busy when I go.,1,positive
"LOVE this Starbucks! After having gone to MULTIPLE locations on the strip and having my Starbucks Double shot made incorrectly every time, coming to this location and having my drink not only just made correctly but made very fuhreakin well; I'm in heaven. Oh yeah and the 2 baristas working were very interactive and friendly, which made it twice as nice. Nothing like your favorite drink made great with a side of friendly conversation.",1,positive
"I have been to this establishment a few times because it is the closest to my home. Each time I sit in the drive thru wondering why it takes so long to make coffee beverages and what is the point of a drive THRU. However, I have gone inside as well and the service is still slow. My order has never been wrong, but I always have to leave with ample time for work. The people that work there have an okay attitude -not really super pleasant, but not rude or mean.",0,negative
"Bring a sweater! They keep it coooold in here. I think all Starbucks are cold in order to get you to buy some hot coffee.  This Starbucks was clean, had friendly staff,  and had outlets for me to use- always a plus. Of course, I was lucky they weren't crowed on Saturday afternoon.  There's a nice covered outdoor area to relax and enjoy your purchase as well. If I lived closer, I'd frequent this particular Starbucks.",1,positive
I love Starbucks but these place is something else. They have way too many workers doing god knows what. The cashier doesn't look up or smile when taking your order. I always order the same drink cinnamon dolce but it taste funny when I order it twice here. I would not waste my time coming to this place keep driving go to the Starbucks on Flamingo and sandhill,0,negative
"The latte is good (trust me, almost any coffee would be good after a night out in vegas and early morning conference wake up call), but the lines here are ridiculous since it's right next to the conference area. Save yourself some time and go to the Starbucks outside. It'll be faster (even though it looks farther).",0,negative
Just your average Starbucks.  Nothing special.  The breakfast sandwiches are so hot and burn my mouth on every occassion.  I have told the sales people but they say they have to cook them at a certain temperature.,0,negative
"Fuddruckers in the casino has better coffee. This place is Starbucks everything, but not called Starbucks possibly because the people don't care, the muffins are stale and the coffee is burnt.",0,negative
"The girl who worked in the Starbucks lacked customer services, unfriendly and are very rude. Not the kind of service I typically gets at Starbucks.",0,negative
"People, Lets not talk about the freekin parking lot ?\n\nI Checked out Starbucks Coffee in the Banksville Plaza, And I gotta say, I was impressed.\n\nThe crew was in perfect sync. very friendly and accommodating. \n\nI have to give kuttos to the gal who fetched my coffee and spice cake .....Tall very pretty, Happy, smiling, Sincerely cares about her customers and her job.\n\nIt would be hard to walk in here with a grumpy attitude.\n\n\n\nOhh,And The Coffee & Cake were good too !",1,positive
Starbucks makes everyday better!!! The staff is always very nice and they are super fast if you're in a hurry!,1,positive
"A chain, so the items are still the same famous coffee we have all grown to love. The staff is very courteous, I don't know what it is though, no matter how small the order is, they ALWAYS mess up my order.\nALWAYS.\n\n\nIf I don't get to work on time this morning, because I had to come inside to fix an order I told them precisely in the drive through, today will be my last day here. \n\n\nHappy trails!",0,negative
Super busy Starbucks they take forever in the drive thru do I went inside and it took forever inside a few employees just standing around doing nothing while everyone else was running their butts off not very professional I will go back because it's the only one in the area,0,negative
"I love Cafe Rio - the service at this location was extremely laid back. Visited after the lunch rush, so the employees might have been slowing down since no one was in line behind me. Employees did not look happy - but the food was really good!",1,positive
"Employees are nice, but prices are double any other Starbucks that I've ever been to. The also don't have a Starbucks card scanner. If you're going to charge crazy prices at least have good technology. Last time I get Starbucks at Aria.\n\n*after coming back the next day it appears they double charged me, but I'll never know since they didn't give me a receipt.",0,negative
They do a mighty fine job. I've had black coffee and a breakfast sandwich several times. The early people are at full speed early.,1,positive
"For the number of staff at this Starbucks, I am at a complete loss how it takes so long to get coffee. I regularly have to wait a few minutes before a cashier takes my order, and they have given me the wrong size or blend of coffee on multiple occasions.  The drive-thru is typically 5-10 cars deep, and it takes an inordinately long time compared to other Starbucks .  I'm not sure if there are staffing problems or are just disorganized.  Great location, but disappointing service.",0,negative
Came in the am for my free coffee on opening day!  I am a first timer and I can say I'm officially a fan.  Employees were all very friendly and I even took a selfie with them!  Love it!  They were all smiles.\n\nMusic was loud but that makes the environment fun.  I had the Cocomo on ice and it was very good.\n\nThis compared to Starbucks?  Both are equally good and close to price.  I like both.\n\nCan't wait to try more!,1,positive
"The customer service here is not that bad. The coffee on the other hand is lacking in quality. Actually, it's some of the worst coffee I've ever had. Some of the sandwich options are tolerable, but it's a coffee shop... and the coffee is awful. Also,  there is a fee to use your card if under 5 dollars. Pfft",0,negative
Says they deliver on here... Wrong & wrong again & should not be checked! I like Applebee's & thought the delivery was something new for the Pittsburgh area... Don't know if this is something Yelp does or something someone checked off... But not cool!,1,positive
"Guys, WTF?  Ate here because of the great reviews on yelp.  Ended up throwing away basically all of our food.  The meats were all chewy and grossly over-battered.  It was highly disgusting and mostly inedible.  I blame yelp for wasting my boyfriends $40 and calories on this crap.",0,negative
"I was shocked to see the relatively decent reviews on Yelp as I had a pretty awful experience here. While I don't actually know you, I respect you as my fellow Yelper and will not bore you with the details. Nor will I discourage you from trying Grape Street for yourself. However, I will never consider coming back. 'Nough said.",0,negative
"Food ok, but Mint is so close, I'm not sure why I'd ever bother again.\n\nWait...why DID I come here?  That's right, the yelp \""""deal.\""""  They seemed extremely put out to have to handle with my take out order and their annoyance only increased when I mentioned my \""""deal.\""""  I apologize that you had to take my money, India Palace...I promise it'll never happen again!",0,negative
"Ugh, I left a Review and took Pictures at this place and some how YELP has lost it or something did work the way it was supposed to but....\n\nThis place is amazing, Love the view, The food and the service. I had the entire dish in the I Phone Review now it is gone and the servers name ...UGH, Disappointing and the view.\n\nI definitely love this place and recommend it highly.",1,positive
They don't honor yelp check ins. They want the coupon printed out.. Yep turned around and walked out. Won't be back,0,negative
"Maaan my first bad Yelp. This place is a customer service disaster... no hi. No how are ya. No kiss my ass nothing, stonewalled at the register. Tweaker bitch in the back busy doing laps. Peanut Paradise looks like shit ditto on the cookies. I just wanted a cookie :/ 2 stars cause the joint is clean and with everyone hopped up on whatever they where quick. Needs improvement to say the least.",0,negative
"Oh Yelp how I have forsaken thee.  I strayed from the true path and trusted the recommendation of a coworker about the Fajita Grill.  Lies, all lies, to lure me away from you.  Will you ever forgive me. I swear it meant nothing.\n\nThe chicken mole and the fajitas were okay, but were expensive.  What really says it all though is that they charged us for stale chips and salsa.",0,negative
The service and the food has gone so downhill lately. Used to be so much better. We complained to the guy who said he was the manager and his name was Jerry. He just stood there and laughed at us. I guess when you do so much business you don't need to care about your customers or in this case ex customers. I wish yelp would allow negative stars.,0,negative
"Com'on, Yelp...check out Chris B and Tom K...(is that the names?).  I'll stand by my reviews anytime.\n\nAnyway, my stars just went down to 2.  Any questions why??",0,negative
I wanted put zero but yelp does not allow.Worst place ever...the owner is rude an thinks that he owns the world....we went in once there...the waiter made us sit and wait only to be told that they don't serve what we wanted...and the to top it all the owner says he didnt have time...seriously I don't know how the food was but in no case can the owner be rude....would never advise anyone to go here... Worst place,0,negative
"Read the reviews.... still went. Sigh.... incompetent waitress. Wings were good... that's it.Sorry, why have a service like yelp if you don't heed to the reviews. I will next time. RUN AWAY!",0,negative
Went to this location and told them about the Yelp advertisement for One large with 5 toppings for $10.99. They stated that it must be an expired coupon and that they aren't even on Yelp. I explained that you are on Yelp and someone needs to either pull the advertisement or honor it. They refused to honor the Yelp coupon. \n\nNot sure that I would come back after that. They are in now way trying to accommodate the customer.,0,negative
Yelp has never let us down yet. We love the food here..affordable and was enough to fill up our bottomless pit son!,1,positive
"I have trusted Yelp a lot so tried. \nReally?? I could not think this place is great ;;\nNothing special.  Not many toppings;;\nAlso, I do not like their 'Tip-pushing' card reader.\nIt was very unpleasant  experience to be asked pay tips before I get my food.\nI will not go there again.",0,negative
Don't waste your time!!  There are so many better options in the area.  We ignored the Yelp reviews and ended up regretting eating here.,0,negative
Nice place and friendly staff... I'm new to yelp but a long time regular here... They are always ready for me when I come in and most of them already know what I want.\nThe only downfall here is they tend to run out of my favorite drinks once every 6 weeks and it takes a week or two for them to restock it.,1,positive
10/19/2014 I was messaged here on yelp by someone claiming to work for this company.... I was asked if I would please edit my review to a 5 star and to change my story for a free bottle of ejuice.... WOW this place just gets worse and worse that's so pathetic.,0,negative
"My wife and I were a little disappointed by a menu with 5 options (plus one dessert) and almost walked out when nothing jumped out at us. But we put our faith in the Yelp! community.  \nSo glad we stayed!  We shared a couple things and it was one of the best lunches we've had anywhere.  Our favorite was the the summer squash salad, but everything was amazing.  Will definitely be back next time in Scottsdale.",1,positive
Goodness.......... Possibly first bad review I've given on yelp. Manager was incredibly RUDE. Apparently you don't matter as a customer if you are close to their closing time. Can't believe the rudeness of this supervisor when asked simple questions. Will not return.,0,negative
"We loved it. We have finally found a great gelato shop in Charlotte.\nHave the pistachio. \nBring back your friends, they will love it.\nGet back on yelp and let the people know what you think.",1,positive
This is my only review I've wrote on yelp after using this app for years. I'm writing it because I was so satisfied with this cafe. I ordered off of eat24 and my food was at my door FAST! It's nice having delivery options especially when it's good food and fast. I don't know what that other guy was complaining about you guys kick ass,1,positive
"went here for restaurant week and the service was amazing. They took a little longer than normal to serve our food so they gave us free dessert and appetizer. The food was good and this place looked like a little cabin, giving it a nice homey feel.",1,positive
"Nothing remarkable about this place. \n\nThe foot quality was good, but our food wasn't all that well prepared.  I ordered a spicy chicken dish, and I didn't taste much spice above and beyond the sweet and sour sauce with some dried red chilis.\n\nThe service was good here, but we were one of 3 tables...",0,negative
"This is a pretty nice place-\nIt is reasonably priced and the service was very good, so were the drinks.\nI ordered the salmon and it tasted very good, although it was a little dry.\nThe atmosphere was very nice, although the restaurant is very small inside.\nThis means that there isn't much room between the tables, hence I could hear the conversation held by everyone near me.\n\nOtherwise a very good place, would definitely recommend it to others.",1,positive
"The food and service were great! This is a cozy, intimate place perfect for a date night, but may not work so well for large groups",1,positive
Great food and awesome service.  I ordered the appetizer sliders (wasn't too hungry) and got a huge portion - 4 sliders (cheeseburgers) with fries.  My associate ordered the appetizer size mussels and commented they were the best he's ever had (and he's had them all over the world).  Inside was a little noisy.  Generous outside patio space was quieter.,1,positive
"Great food, meh service.  There's less than a handful of places that treat you different when you ask for house water (or \""""water\"""" for the rest of us).  This is definitely one of them.  The food Lamb Special Pizza, Mussels and Apple Salad were great.  It reminded me of our neighborhood BJ restaurant.  But we were so fed up trying to find our absentee waiter we just left the payment and left.",0,negative
"This was another visit to this establishment and, as in past visits, was a pleasurable experience. Their service from host/hostess stand to final bill by server was a pleasure. The food selections are almost massive in quantity, the quality of those I have consumed have been well balanced with various spices/sauces. Wines are more than appropriate. Wait service is excellent, courteous, knowledgable of menu and it's items and worth the visit. It is one of the better \""""chain\"""" types.",1,positive
My wife and I went here after reading all of the Yelp reviews. We were not that impressed. The dinning room was too bright and had a banquet hall feel. The prime rib was good but not awesome. I had a better prime rib and enjoyed the atmosphere more at the Palm in the Forum Shops.,0,negative
"Hiddem gem! \n\nGreat food and service. \n\nThis  place is fine dining with an emphasis on service, being a new dad I'm new to this not bringing your new born to nice restuarants and honestly don't believe in that. She is going where I am going. \nStaff did not skip a step, brought hot water for the bottle no dirty looks. \n\nThought the food was great and fairly reasonable for upscale dining.",1,positive
"It has been years since my husband and I ate here with a group of friends, but I still remember it as a wonderful dining experience.  The room was vibrant and current; the atmosphere was fun, but sophisticated, the restaurant itself was busy and bustling.  Excellent food and good wine list.  I wholeheartedly recommend this restaurant, for both groups and romantic dinners.",1,positive
I went there for my first date. The service was wonderful. The steak was also wonderful and I love love love their frites. I would definitely visit agaib,1,positive
"Fantastic food and service.  My wife and I both had the filet - each was cooked perfectly to our specifications.  The lobster mashed potatoes were great, and the desserts were wonderful.  Its away from the casino so there was no smoky air.  The staff was extremely attentive.  It was an anniversary dinner and our desserts were accompanied with a firework.  Will be back.  The occasion was perfect.  Thanks BOA!",1,positive
"I liked this place. It was good, but I dont know if I would go back again because a) its still fairly pricey and b) I dont think you totally get your moneys worth. Our waiter was slow (very nice) but he seemed to just walk around and forget about us. We had two witch doctors, a good drink to get if you go there. The view is great, we sat in a booth facing outside and loved it. The food was pretty good. Not incredible, but pretty good.",1,positive
Party of 5 went there on 11/24/2011. Food was mediocre. Most of it was undercooked. \n\nService was AWFUL!  We had to ask for water- repeatedly and wait long for it. Server gave us food for another table. He then brought out our food and walked around the room with it- not knowing where to take it.\n\nYou can get better service in a cheap dinner! It is outrageous for the prices they charge.,0,negative
We wanted a close cheap restaurant to Encore and this was the best option. The menu is pretty limited. The decor and the ambiance of the restaurant was however beautiful! We were seated for 10 minutes before anyone even greeted us. The servers were all over the place like lost lil sheep. The food was alright but not worth what we paid.,0,negative
"Great atmosphere, easy to book and get reservations, extensive wine list.. Mind boggling to say the least if you arent overly knowledgeable with wines like myself.  Antipasta appetizer was excellent.. Perfect blend of italian cheeses and meets.  I had the pasta sampler which included lobster gnocchi.. Obviously homemade gnocchi and cooked to perfection.  Service was excellent, very attentive waiter but not overly attentive which is good.  Price is as expected for a restaurant of this quality at the mgm grand hotel",1,positive
"The view is incredible! But if you're planning on a good meal to go along with the nice view,,,think again! This place was AWFUL!!!! From the bland salad and the horrible appetizers and the very -over priced dinner, it's just one disappointment to the next. If you just have to go here,,,get a drink, sit in the lounge and enjoy the music and the great view. DON'T Eat here you will be very disappointed!",0,negative
"If you enjoy great Southern cuisine,this will be the place for you! the food is amazing...the service is perfect...and the ambience is excellent! I enjoyed the beef short ribs...and a wonderful arugula salad with feta..SO fresh!",1,positive
"Great service. We went for a belated birthday and they treated us very nicely and with a lot of attention. This place is easy to find and pretty central. We got the 33oz bone in ribeye, mac and cheese, and also brussels sprouts. We ordered it medium rare and it came out pretty rare in general (which was fine with us). The ambiance is nice and since it's a large open kitchen with patio and bar space...you have a lot of options in terms of seating.",1,positive
"Great food, view was ok, service was excellent. Total bill for 2 was $175 with appetizers, salads, and main course, and drinks. Not bad",1,positive

"fantastic service, great food, cozy decor, i could spend a lot of money at this place, fantastic wine list, but again by the bottle at a huge mark up, would be nice if they were not so greedy with the wine prices, but the corkage is only $ 25.00 and that i can live with. somewhat overpriced even for the strip, but its darn good,  a pleasing array of menu items, wonderful service, i will be back,",1,positive
"Great food with great flavor, nice place to have a romantic dinner, I had the paella with was delicious but my girlfriend had the lamb which I thought I would have order that too. The waiter was very polite and always there if we needed something I would definitely go back and try some other foods on there menu.",1,positive
Great place for a dinner date or to woo a client or a propective hire. Great steak!! Went there for my anniversary and the valet puts a nice touch on the evening. Be prepared to walk out full.,1,positive
"First time at St. Francis last night. Good menu selection, had an excellent server, good portion size and excellent meal.  I tried the chicken salad for dinner and it was tasty and just then right size.  They have provided a nice atmosphere with exposed brick, stainless steel tables, and just the right amount of lighting and music.  \n\nOnly downside was the backless seats at our booth. Very trendy, but somewhat uncomfortable. Ask for a table instead and you'll be fine. \n\nI'll return.",1,positive
The view is beautiful and worth the trip up to the top floor of TheHotel for the view alone.   \nMy husband and I enjoyed some great food including blue fin tuna sashimi.  I was impressed with the food; I often find that restaurants with  pretentious d\u00e9cor don't pay attention to the food but Mix did not disappoint.,1,positive
Fabulous all the way around! \nAmbiance feels authentic like you have just walked in an old Irish pub!\nComplete with live music! Ordered a salad fresh quality and different in a good way! \n Best soup ever is the Colcannon soup! OMG I will be craving this the rest of my life! Fabulous service and laid back crowd!,1,positive
"Good, solid tasty food, well prepared in sizable amounts for reasonable prices. Waiters were friendly. Bartender poured big glasses of wine. Always a good option at home or travelling.",1,positive
"Decent food for the price. Not the best atmosphere. But overall, not a bad choice for a casual meal.",0,negative
The ULTIMATE dining experience. Not sure where to begin...but the service is the most grandeur I have encountered. Felt like royalty from various managers coming to introduce themselves and ensure our dining experience was top notch. The decor takes your breath away and the presentation of all courses is simply A+. The menu was as expected and we ordered the fish specials which pleased our palates.,1,positive
AMAZING! incredibly knowledgeable staff.  i got the wine pairings and all were delicious.  overall an amazing experience. it is pricey but worth the splurge.,1,positive
"can't see any reason to dine here. The atmosphere was dull, the food ranged from OK to yuck (we tried to send one dish back, but they weren't interested), service was OK but not great, and they close early. Very disappointing. The best part of the experience was spinning the prayer wheels near the entrance, hopefully to spare our party from food poisoning.",0,negative
First time here and the restaurant itself is unique it had a real Southern feel but the service was not too hot. The waitress kept forgetting everything and wasn't very attentive. She finally came around towards the end of our visit but by then it was too late. The food was OK. I had the bbq shrimp but it tasted more like shrimp drowned in cocktail sauce and it was over priced... Probably won't come back blah,0,negative
"Overall good experience. Loved the garlic tapenade and bread, paired with a 2009 Louis Martini Cab.\n\nCaesar salad was ok, a little watery instead of pasty bold flavor, fixed with a little extra dressing.\n\nI ordered the Rib Eye Special, the husband ordered Pasta with sausage, neither were memorable. Our friends enjoyed the Chilean Sea Bass and Lasagna\n\nOur waiter Glenn was good and accommodating.\nWe didn't care for Francisco the asst. waiter, limited English and not helpful.",1,positive
"If you live close by & money is not the issue, The place is quiet; simple decoration, good for lunch meet with friends. \n\nI ordered Shrimp noodle soup. Only two things in clear soup. shrimp & noodle, that's it.\n Bean Sprout & Basil was on the side, it was for you to put in boiling hot soup right before you eat, but the soup came out luke warm.\n\nThis $9 Shrimp noodle soup dish is too bland to serve in restaurant.\nI can think of many other restaurant to spend this amount & get very tasty dish.",0,negative
"My first time here was last night and I was quite impressed! Half of the walls are white half are red (a nod to wine, no doubt) the lighting fixtures were lovely and the decor was cozy! \nTwo friends and I shared a bottle of wine, some chocolate fondue and quite a lot of laughs! Our waitress was friendly and knowledgeable although it seemed as if she was the only one there. \nGreat time great wine great location! Will certainly be returning!",1,positive
My wife and I went in on a Tuesday night after shopping (choice of convenience) and I was completely underwhelmed. The service was slow and somewhat lackadaisical not understandable for a Tuesday night at 530. The food was ok but way overpriced for the quality. We tried to like it; we shared wine a starter and our two mains. It just didn't stack up. Not worth the 70 bucks we spent.,0,negative
"Our food was decent but the service was horrible. Our server was rude, hurried our meal, and gave us a dish we had canceled (and subsequently also charged us for his mistake). We enjoyed our food and had a mediocre bottle of wine, but did not like eating in the pitch black; we probably wouldn't go back based on the poor lighting and poor service.",0,negative

The atmosphere is relaxing and entertaining and it was a beautiful day out. Even if its seasonal im definetly waiting and going next summer and telling everyone i know to go as well!",1,positive
All the meat they brought to the table was supurb.  From lamb to beef and bacon wrapped chicken...all luscious.\n\nStaff was quite attentive even though a sea of tables were filled...very busy.\n\nTypical decor and atmosphere of a stylish restaurant.\n\nGreat combo of sit-down and buffet service.\n\nNothing I can say to knock this place.\n\nP.S. Even the gal who answered the phone during dinner hour was polite and attentive.,1,positive
"Excellent food, excellent service.  Pricey, but definitely worth it.  The ambiance is cozy and classy as you sit in a room with just a few other tables.  The Pot de Creme is amazing.",1,positive
"The food was amazing but the price a bit steep and atmosphere truly odd. It was hard to wrap my mind around a delicious $20 entree that was served on a picnic table next to a jaw-breaker machine, pop-dispenser, and a host of other chachke items that made the place feel messy. If the food could be served somewhere nice, I'd go back.  Otherwise, not so much.",0,negative
"Pretty good, but totally empty the night I went. The food was really tasty and the restaurant located very close to the Jury's Inn just round the corner. I would go again. I think I preferred the french place two doors down though.",1,positive
"Consistantly great food, service is hit and miss but always friendly.  We usually get steak dishes, always prime and cooked perfectly.  Great choice for a special night out, fireplaces for cooler weather and misters on the large patio.",1,positive
"Very romantic atmosphere.  Service was excellent. Food was good, and the view was gorgeous. Definitely recommend for date night. Try their homemade gingerale.",1,positive
"We came here for drinks before dinner, and we had a great time.\n\nThey were able to make me a skinny margarita that actually tasted good.  I was impressed.\n\nWe ordered off of their menu.  It is basically small bites from the restaurants on the ground.\n\nSit outside if you can.  The views of the gardens are wonderful.\n\nVanessa was our server, and she was pleasant, attentive, and gave us a lot of information.",1,positive
"The food was very good and it's a cool building, but the service was terrible.  The hostess was not at all friendly and we were seated at a very uncomfortable high top table and got some attitude when we asked to move.  There was hardly anyone in there, so there were plenty of regular tables.  The server didn't even ask if we wanted refills or dessert, just slapped the bill on the table.  I actually was going to get both, but fine I won't spend any more money there.",0,negative
"Yeah I kinda have to agree with the other two reviewers here. It's kinda ok. The atmosphere is not really well thought. The food is okay. I order fillet mignon, it was good. The Caesar salad not so much. It's kinda pricey too.",0,negative
"Went here on a Saturday night at 7pm the place was bizzy with a good buzz about the place, there wasn't any problems atall with the service, we were well looked after by our waitress, the food was great I opted for the fillet steak which was cooked to perfection. we both had 3 courses and 2 btl wine and a btl water and it was \u00a3102 which we thought was quite reasonable for the quality and service we received.",1,positive
"Absolutely loved it!!!  Atmosphere, service, food, just about everything was perfect in this place.  Me and my wife had Chef's Signature tasting menu and everything was just cooked to perfection.  My only complain was we got there 5 minutes before our reservaton time and it took them another 15~20mins until we got seated.  Other than that, I highly recommend.  If you are not sure what to eat, just go with Chef's Tasting menu.  You will enjoy it and leave full and happy! :)",1,positive

"Food is out of this world. Spanish squid and octopus, superb. Creamy polenta, incredible. The spaghetti was amazing! I have not had pasta this good. Worth every penny. Our view was amazing. Service was good and attentive. Our sever knew his stuff and his recommendations were spot on. Minus one star though for the snooty hostess who seemed annoyed that we came there to eat.",1,positive
Great place for dinner...  Nice setting and friendly staff!  The food came within five minutes of ordering and it was phenomonal!,1,positive
"I had never been before but I thought, \""""typical steakhouse, I'm sure it will be ok\"""" I was very wrong. The service was excellent, the wine list was great, the gruyere popovers... Oh my GOSH. The food was wonderful. The interior is rustic/Modern.... love all the wood details. Bright. And a great place for a casual business lunch.",1,positive
"I have dined here on several occasions for lunch and dinner and I have walked away happy every time. This isn't the place to go if your looking for creative or innovative fine dining. The best words I could use to describe the food is upscale bar food. Flat breads, Burgers, Salads, Rotisserie Chickens they have it all. Everything is reasonably priced and you can get in and out pretty quickly without spending a fortune.",1,positive
"good food, good service, had a nice time with son, daughter-in-law and spouse on 10/12. Easy place to hold a conversation over dinner.",1,positive

"I went there for a friend's birthday party.  The decor was very different, you feel like you are in one of the girl clothing store (Modern Luxury feel).  The food was pretty good for it's price.  I had Salmon Salad, Burger and Hanger Steak.  The steak came out cold the first time but the Chef apologize and went ahead made us a new plate right away.  The service was good but it was slow... Our server was nice but everything came out the kitchen were just slow.",1,positive
"Food was very good, nothing new, just prepared very well. Good price for the amount of food. The wait staff seemed they could not be happier, must be into the wine, just kidding. One slight problem that other people noticed, being loud in the room and our party was causing it. We were in the corner of the glass windows and sound reflected well from there. Need some low slung drapes there. This place will become a regular stop.",1,positive
"I like this place...I have to say living within a 3 minute drive is prolly a key factor in us liking this place but it has good food, decent prices, and the environment is chill, modern and slightly upscale (but I still had on jean shorts and a tank top when eating dinner there with my baby and husband)\n\nWe have had the pizzas, salads (chop was good!) and their desserts were also good.  Decent food and convenient for us as a family to dine at.  \n\nTIP to restaurant: get better high chairs please!!!",1,positive
Fantastic food and atmosphere. Service is great too and everything feels just right. Only thing is that the process differed in my case from the bill to the menu and the appetisers given were a bit stingy.,1,positive
First time coming to the place and our server Brea couldn't have been nicer. I wasn't familiar with the menu so I asked her for some suggestions. \n\nThe happy hour here seemed pretty cheap. The food was exceptional. I would definitely come back. \n\nWe went from the dining room out to the patio considering how nice of a day it was outside. \n\nOverall satisfaction with our visit. Great place to eat and pretty cool environment. I would recommend anyone to come and visit this downtown grill and pub.,1,positive
"The place is pretty uppity, but the food is delicious!!\n\n There is an upstairs, midlevel & downstairs areas. Very swanky/hipster style atmosphere. Fun style that all the servers wear chucks!! Giedre, was our server - took a title warming up to, but she was wonderful!!\n\nBest Tip about this place: $36 for the Prime \""""60 Second\"""" NY Strip Steak - WORTH DOUBLE, most mouthwatering steak I have ever tasted!!",1,positive
"I really believe that an atmosphere can make or break a place...in this case I really appreciated all the design and staff decisions. It was like the place walked right out of pinterest .\nI ate at the bar (to avoid the wait) with my friend and the service was just as lovely. The waiters are extremely trendy, flannels and facial hair. Great. \nThe food portions are small but tasty, Ill definitely return.",1,positive

VERY disappointed. No ambiance. Ugly patio. Rude staff. The website menu shows a gluten free option but when I asked about it they seemed irritated. Food isn't great. Wine pours are small. This neighborhood needed a new restaurant/bar but this one isn't going to cut it.,0,negative
"The menu is a little pricey, and service is very hit and miss.  Sometimes the \""""slow food\"""" style will be too much, and it makes the dining experience languish.  The cocktails are delicious, the wine list is decent, nice variety, well-priced, a little pedestrian.  I would not recommend doing a prix fixed event here, it was way too much food, and the food quality dipped greatly when we did this for New Year's eve last year.",1,positive
"The server we had was amazing. I had a bottle of Saratoga water and they would never let my glass get half empty. The food was amazing. The salad area had a lot of great things that you wouldn't find on a normal salad bar. The cinnamon bananas were so good. Of course, the meat was incredible. Eat every kind that they offer you and get seconds on both types of lamb. I highly recommend eating here. You will feel like royalty.",1,positive
Not really like I want.\nI went there with my wife for her birthday. I thought we will be have some surprise on it but totally up side down..... Maybe I expect too much.

You can tell that very detail, from the teapots to the chairs, was carefully thought out. \nWe plan to make it our regular place to dine.",1,positive
First trip to Heritage Tavern since it opened. Very good experience with traditional decor and warm atmosphere. Great service. Food was very good to excellent. I had the braised lamb belly. It was perfectly cooked but had a very strong if not too strong of a lamb flavor. Friends had the braised short ribs which were excellent. We will be back.,1,positive

"Decor and atmosphere really good. Actually a bit upscale for its Eastowne Mall location. Food was good, but not inexpensive. See photo. Ordered ribs and the walleye. Walleye  was tasty and prepared well. Was it worth $20. No, more in the area of $12-14. Service was avg.  Free wi-fi. Too early to tell how this place will fare with lower cost alternatives within earshot.",0,negative
I wish I could do negative stars. They are crooks! And liars! They will rape you any chance they can get and their customer service is a complete joke.

We have the same last name, I had my ID, and signing over checks is still legal...so why wouldn't Chase honor their check? Uhm. I'm guessing because the concept of customer service is foreign to them. There is a happy ending nonetheless. \nMany thanks to Bank of America for waiving there fees and cashing this check like the professionals they are.",0,negative
Not pleased with this branch at all. :/ I see no logic in telling me I can't use checks I am cashing to get a cashiers check when I am an account holder.  BUT..... I can cash those checks come back and they would issue me one? Fucking stupid! !!!! How is that logical? All they did is piss me off to the point I won't come to this branch.

"I like to come here for US Bank. However, the store is another story. Its usually pretty  busy and they only have 1 or 2 cashiers on at night. Its old and run down the staff isn't that friendly.

I will go there for the bank and do my shopping somewhere else.",0,negative

"this review is for my $7 big ass cheesecake that i failed to finish. it was darn good though for that price it was worth it. the service though is slow. we didn't get helped for awhile and it took forever to bring us just water. i believe they just created my cheesecake on the go cuz that too, took forever. our server was nice though but it wasn't enough for me to win her cuz of the lack of speed",1,positive

Great selection of international treats. A little pricey.,1,positive
Not so much.... I've had better it's a nice fix but it reminds me of when I want a coke but some buys me a diet cook .... It's good but not exactly what I wanted,0,negative
Pricey but good,1,positive
"The portions are small, taste was average, and the price was expensive. Tasted better in downtown for way less the cost. 4 people cost over $150 and we left hungry!",0,negative
"Over priced, but decent food. Probably wont go back again.",0,negative
"A tad pricey, but the quality of food is worth it.  The steak kabob was tender and cooked perfectly medium rare.  However, the ground meat kabob such as the ground chicken kabob, you get twice as much meat for the price, but the spices that are used are good.",1,positive
Honestly I don't understand why it has that many good reviews. I just feel it was normal. $50 is kinda not worthy. It didn't have a large variety.,0,negative
"It was OK, nothing special.  The portions were pretty good, but overall, I felt it was on the pricey side for what was offered.",0,negative
Overpriced and small portions.,0,negative
"I would give a 5, but it's pricey and definitely a treat type of dessert.\n\nWe have enjoyed all their natural tasting flavored paletas.  My favorite is the pecan/nuez!!\n\nLove that they're in tempe, I use to travel to chandler.  And they sell a cooler you can buy and store your paletas in for traveling home in the AZ heat.\n\nWay better than the paletero who use to pass by my house when I was little, but just more expensive :(  Although, I do love to think of that jingle and running screaming \""""STOP!!\""""",1,positive
"Looked interesting and so we decided to hit it up with a bunch of friends.  Saw the rave reviews on Yelp and sure enough--it was good.  But it's just cheese in a pastry.  Nothing special.  They're pretty small too.  I paid 13$ for two cheese in pastries.  But hey, it seemed authentic and the owners were friendly.  Really, I just expected more.",0,negative
"Tried it once w/ the kids, won't be back.\nNot bad, but for their high prices and the quality, there are better choices in LV.\n\nNoise level is high.",0,negative
So worth the money.  We ate for 3 hours it was so good and so many option's it was absolutely delicious no matter what you had and the service was superior.,1,positive
"Overpriced, save some money and go to Famous Dave's more bang for your buck and the food tastes the same if not better.",0,negative
"Fleming is way too expensive for their dishes.  I ordered baked halibut with few pieces of broccoli. The portion was small and it was $38. Besides the boiled broccoli, nothing came with it. Gf got three small  pieces of lamb chop for $25. The ambient and staffs are nice but it is way over price. The food is okay nothing special. I saw many good reviews so I decided to try but disappointed. I would expect a generous portion and a great taste for that price. Would not come back or recommend.",0,negative
Highly overpriced and food was cold. Our waitress seemed confused and didn't know the menu. She had no idea about gluten free. The gluten free bun was awful.,0,negative
I will never forget Campiti's. As a youngster growing up playing on Potomac Avenue and Dormont. My favorite pizza was and still is Campiti's. I have not found an equal in the 18 years I have been in CA. The hoagies were pretty damn good too.,1,positive
"The pizza here, phenomenal! They have a sweeter marinara sauce, it's to die for. Their appetizer 3 meatballs in vodka cream sauce, ahh melt in your mouth amazing. I tried the spaghetti calzone in vodka cream sauce this last time, and it was great! Service is always good. If it's busy, which it always is, food can take a little while to come out, but it's worth it!! Oh and you get a free canoli on your birthday :)",1,positive
"I am from Chicago and have only found places I like.  Hadn't tried Nellos and heard it was good, so my wife and I went there today for lunch.  We had their thin crust deluxe.  Was disappointed.  It was very thin, but crust was not airy, like I am used to.  And being from Chicago, I like my Italian Sausage, not pepperoni.  The sausage was bland and was almost freeze dried.  No flavor, not moist.  It crumbled.  Very disappointed.  Sorry.",0,negative
"Pizza by the slice.. crust is crunchy and just right:) \n\nWe had a chance encounter with this place, by just driving by and decided to give it a whirl. Its a nice tiny eatery on the corner and it must be legit, because almost all the people ordering take-out and dining in were Italian.. We only tried the pizza by the slice, so cannot comment on anything else. \n\nGive it a try!",1,positive
"Venezia's is by far the best place to get a slice in Tempe. 2 slices and a drink for $5.50, and the slice are huge and can be hard for me to finish. The pizza is always fresh and hasn't been sitting out all day like at Slices. The wings and salads are average, but will get the job done when needed. The sandwiches are legit, but stick to the pizza, you won't be disappointed. It used to be an awkward table set up but they just re-did the seating. Bottom line it's the best NY style slice around!",1,positive
Thought we'd try something new other than Papa Johns. I'm very pleased to say we will be ordering from here in the future. \n\nWe were pretty skeptical whether or not we needed a large or extra large so we went to the XL Venezia supreme and hot wings. \n\nThe tasting of the pizza and wings were exquisite! Not too much marinara and just enough cheese. Our order was expected 45 to an hour wait but we ended up waiting about 40 minutes. \n\nVery satisfied with our first experience.,1,positive
"I love Jesse's pizza and am much happier giving them my business over Metro. My husband and I love the fact that they're a small, local place that turns out a great product. There's always something awesome about having a staff greet you by name with a smile. Not to mention, their prices can't be beat. You can't even get a frozen pizza at the grocery store as inexpensive as their large plain cheese.",1,positive
"Pizza is very good, havent tried anything else yet, however their service is just as bad as most new yorkers, they charge 50CENTS for refills! bunch of cheapskates! only on the strip you can get away with that!",0,negative
"I don't know about you, but this is my favorite pizza place in all of Pittsburgh! Can't go wrong with Aiello's. It's small and cozy, but it's exactly what I'd expect from a pizza place on Sq. Hill. Late college night? Try this pizza. It is amazing, it is delicious, and I wish I could go here more often.",1,positive
"Three Iconic pizza places in the same block.  Napoli's is hands down the best.  The other two beat any chain hands down, but Napoli's is tops.  We had about 15 people over the to the house and had a blind taste test.  Locals, a couple of southerns, some Swedes, a Venezuelan.  Napoli's pepperoni beat the other two hands down.  Better than most NYC joints and ALL Chicago pizzerias.",1,positive
"The brick oven pizza is pretty good and their salads and pasta are also great.  While the food is good and the service pretty quick beware of the crowds.  This place is packed with yuppies and their children (I am talking tons of children), so you might have to wait a little while.",1,positive
Perfect pizza!  Found this place on Yelp on the way out of the Charlotte Airport. It looked so good I actually turned around and back-tracked a few miles. So glad that I did!  Friendly staff and great food!  Real Italian food - from a guy who grew up in Jersey b,1,positive

"I love the margherita pizza here!! Right amount of sauce, chunks of mozzarella cheese, and big leaves of basil! Delicious, hot, perfect!!! They get their bread from the Breadsmith off Power and McDowell. Its great!!! They have great wine, pizza, drinks and desserts! Come check out this adorable place! There is a wait on the weekends so try and get in early on the weekdays!! Their cappuccinos are delicious with some decent tiramsu! Enjoy!!!\n\nTo bad they don't deliver!!!",1,positive
My fav pizza place in town. Jalape\u00f1o/Pepperoni way to go\n\nBest pizza in town\n\nIf you havent gone to Joe's and left the town. You missed the delicious pizza which this town offers.,1,positive
"When it comes to chain delivery pizza, Hungry Howie's and Papa Johns take all. Hungry Howie's is good fast pizza. But realistically I think that it takes the cake because of the crust selections! \n\n-Original\n-Ranch\n-Cajun\n-Onion\n-Garlic Herb\n-Butter\n-Butter Cheese\n-Sesame.\n\nThe fact that you get to choose your crust is a genius concept and I would take Howies over Pizza Hut, Dominos, and most other big pizza chains.",1,positive
"We stopped by Little Italy on our way home from Laughlin, NV and I have to say this place was amazing.  We had the gourmet pizza, and aside from it being huge, the topping were fresh, the crust was awesome and the service was great.  If your travels ever take you to Gila Bend definitely stop by Little Italy.",1,positive
I really love thus pizza best of all! The meat lovers is my favorite for a regular day. When we are in the mood for some spicy... The southwestern chicken pizza is insane good! The boneless chicken wings are awesome. Me being very picky with chicken I think these are hands down better than buffalo wild wings for sure. If your in the mood for pizza thus is the place to eat!!!,1,positive
I ordered from Hungry Howie's many times and they never disappoint. I think their pizzas have a fresh taste and I like the flavored crust. The cinnamon bread is excellent too!,1,positive
"I'm from Chicago and I have to say Rosatis has a very good thin crust pizza. Their sausage also has the seasonings I am accustomed to from back home. I order Rosatis when I'm in the mood for a softer crust and lots of gooey cheese. Lastly, how can you eat pizza without Hot Giardinera peppers? Their peppers are GREAT!",1,positive
"Went to sardellas for the first time since, I was new to the area and was presently surprised. When I walked in I was greeted by a younger gentleman named Matt who gave me great descriptions of different types if pizza and even sold me on the wings which are my new favorite! Great customer service along with short waiting time for the food must go an try for your self!",1,positive
"I love Red Devil! It's casual with great food and amazing service. Try more than their pizza... The wings, fried zucchini, and pasta is all good. Can't find anything I dislike about this place!",1,positive
"I call CPK, safe adventure.  It's great when you have to go somewhere with a large group, and you don't want to cave into a totally non-descript chain.  Everyone can find something on the menu that they can tolerate, and I actually think the pizzas are quite good.  The prices are average, and the service is typically friendly.  The next time you have a business meeting or large group to accomodate, I recommend it.",1,positive

I absolutely LOVED Pomo! The pizza was delicious and if you've ever been to Italy you'd know this pizza is authentically Italian! My one and only complaint would be that there was a bit of a wait but  which was nice. They have some great outdoor seating and the atmosphere was great. If you haven't been I suggest you go!,1,positive
"We eat a Cousin Vinny's anytime we are in Peoria visiting family.  The pizza is always delicious and the service is great too. \n\nPlus, we were able to sit on the patio with our dog.  We entered using the gate on the side and of course our dog knows his manners at a restaurant.",1,positive
"I never have any complaints about the location on Montford in Charlotte! From the person that takes the order, the time it takes to prepare, to delivery or pick up, they are always friendly and the price is right. I try different pizzas, but always get an antipasto with it. Pizza always has plenty of toppings and so do the salads.",1,positive
"Delicious pizza by the slice or whole pie - very good all around place. I usually just get a slice of cheese, but yesterday, we got a whole pizza, and it was even good this morning. If you're there, try the Italian ices that they have. Really decent tiramisu as well. Especially for a fast-food place.",1,positive
"We are pizza lovers and I have to say Papa Murphys is by far the best we've ever had! Our favorite are the stuffed pizzas, you won't find anything like it around!",1,positive
"Oh, Rossi's! The guy who answers the phone has a silky radio DJ voice. I just want to listen to that guy talk, but then he's asking me whether I want slices or squares, so. Anyway, the pizza. It's pretty damn good. Basic, thin crust, comes in crazy huge sizes if you want a crazy huge pizza. The inside of the place is like stepping back in time 30 years. It seriously feels like 1984 in there (the actual year, not the book).",1,positive
"Remarkable pizza and salad. We visited from San Antonio, TX and my in-laws recommended Buon Gusto. All 7 of us went, 4 adults and 3 kids and the kids all said it was the best pizza they have ever had. It was very good pizza. Service was great. All fresh, organic and the right temperature.",1,positive
My best and I tried the Margherita pizza w/ the Mister Mister. -- Couldn't go wrong. I'm a fan!,1,positive
The Diavolo pizza is the best pizza I've ever had! Way better than Bicanco! It's a must have is you like a little kick with your pizza.,1,positive
Born and raised in Chicago. Not quite Lou Malanti's or Giordano's but it's the best pizza we've found so far in Az!!,1,positive
We are from out of town and randomly picked Gino's.  The 4 cheese pizza was the best pizza I've had.....maybe ever.  Their fries are home made.  Great food.  I highly recommend it.,1,positive
"This is supposed to be a non-smoking hotel, but they let guests smoke on the balconies. Second-hand smoke is sucked into the through-the-wall air conditioning units and  your room smells like smoke. There is nothing management can do except give you a free breakfast, if you complain. Sad.",0,negative
Be prepared for second hand smoke,0,negative
I had a non smoking floor yet we can smell the smoke in our room. Our clothes smell like it our hair. Shower was dirty. They didn't turn our phone on so I had to use my cell phone to call the front desk. I will not stay there again. I do like that it was across the street from a Thai place and a nice bar/lounge.,0,negative
"Skip this hotel.  Arrived to what I thougth was a spa room, except it was a smoking room.  What part of spa evokes smoking.  When I tried to move, they said they were sold out.  The operator offered me a 50 food credit which was something but really, a smoking room.  They did finally move me the next day but I'm still fried about the whole thing.  I found an actual cig lighter under the bed.  gross.  I will not be staying at this hotel again.",0,negative
Love this place. Only down side is its a little too smoky for my taste,1,positive
This place was empty came here twice. Mabe 2 groups at the most were in here. Ultra high prices Hookahs cost 20 to 30 dollars its nuts. They don't smoke that great and the guy working there was a little creepy he would pop up all over the place. The prices where just outrageous there's palace in summerlin that's way cheaper and nicer. I would npt recommend this place.,0,negative
"Smokers paradise!  It's a stink hole because of the \""""outside\"""" bar.  It's a joke, really.  I think the smoke-free laws are being violated here.  My family and I won't be back.\n\nWish I could give this cruddy place NO STARS.",0,negative

I originally booked my stay in Vegas here at Ballys.  After check in I went to the room and I couldn't believe the bad odor of cigarette smoke.

"Mimosa is fantastic. I went there for lunch recently for my friend's birthday. I had the best cheeseburger I've ever had in my life. It was topped with bacon and cheddar cheese, but the burger itself was just seasoned perfectly. Mm mm. It is on the pricey side, but it's definitely more reasonably priced for lunch, so I'd recommend checking it out then. As other Yelpers have said, it's just one of those restaurants where everything you order is likely to be good.",1,positive
"Tried this place for lunch, had the chicken burro and have to agree with the other reviewers. I wouldn't recommend Matador and am still baffled that it was packed at lunchtime.",0,negative
The Mexican pizza add beef and cream cheese is to die for!  Their fried ice cream is the best ever.  The chili relleno is very flavorful and delicious.   My favorite Mexican food  restaurant!,1,positive
"Finally doing a review after visiting Arriba's for years. This past stay stuck with the Chimichanga with Machaca beef covered in Green Sauce. Loved it! Over the years got the Posole (since I have a Posole addiction); but I resisted this time. If you like spicy head to Arriba's. They also have great margaritas, had the mango margarita. Will be back again!",1,positive
"Sometimes months will go by and I forget about Rubios. Then I'll have it and I'm reminded how good it is!\n\nThe salsa bar rocks. Chips are free with every meal. Prices are reasonable. Oh, and they have some healthy options as well (the HealthMex tacos/burritos are really yummy!).\n\nMy husband LOVES their fish tacos--the original AND the grilled versions as well.",1,positive
"Yum. Baja fresh is the place to go if you want something a step up from Chipotle in variety and warmth as far as the food goes. \nIt's not finger licking if I don't have this I\""""m gonna die good, but the food is made fresh, and the customer service is always excellent\nHighlight: the plethora of salsa choices as well as fresh cut limes for your meal & if you so choose your coke like beverage. :)",1,positive
"Red chille Carne is the best. Every Wednesday they have special priced menu where meals are 7.95 and kids eat for 1.50. Such a great deal and it is very filling. The food is always fresh and hot when they sever you. Bean dip and salsa with chips when u first arrive, um I'm good. Definitely recommend this place for any occasion.",1,positive
"Love burrito shack. Don't ever let the looks of it fool you. Great food, nice people and did I mention great food?!?!\n\nI was skeptical about going to the Burrito shack at first, but once I did I get it pretty often. I have not tried many things because I am stuck on one burrito because it is so good. The service is always friendly and even when the wait is long they still get your food to you as fast as possible and my order is always correct.",1,positive
"As others have suggested, the green chili is fantastic.  It really is the best.  \n\nTheir beans are very good too.  Not too salty like other places.  \n\nI wasn't overly impressed with their tacos though.  It wasn't bad, just that I've had better.  When I go back (and I will be back!) I'll pass on the tacos, but that just leaves more room for green chili burros.",1,positive
"Loved this place! Found this place through yelp! Service was great, super clean and friendly. Not to mention, their food was Delicious! We ordered the steak cilantro, chile verde quesadilla and chicken burrito (enchilada style). Portion sizes are huge so try not to get full on the chips salsa and beans. :)",1,positive
"ARROZ CON POLLO!!!!  This place is worth it great staff, great atmosphere, awesome food even down to the little tortilla wit whipped cream and strawberry sauce at the end of the meal. The guy that comes around with the guacamole cart makes killer guacamole. The portions are massive I consider myself a big eater and I have a hard time finishing my meal. The staff is great they come into my store after hours and are just as friendly at that time as they are when at work so I guess that means they are sincere. Great place",1,positive
"Just ate at Senor Tequila for the first time in a while. They have added some good specials at lunch time so the prices are very affordable. My lunch dish was under $7 and the quality of the food was good. As always, service can be hit or miss here, but I stil like the food and will definitely go back.   Also, they have taken over some space from next door, so finally the restaurant will be a little roomier.",1,positive
Burrito Express is a delicious choice for a Mexican lunch. It is very different from the local taco stand (Filiberto's or Amado's) but that does not mean that it's not as good. The tortillas are extremely tasty.,1,positive
"I love Elmer's.  Try the strips and sauce they are different but so good. They have great green chili burritos, shredded beef tacos are also a  favorite of mine. Avoid going here at lunch time mon thru fri it is very popular with chandler high kids.",1,positive
This is my Chandler go to place for Mexican food. Some things to be aware of:   \n(1) during school lunches they are packed\n(2) you pay for the chips and salsa\n(3) there is a cost of refills \nlook beyond that and you will have some great food for a very decent price!,1,positive
"The BEST Filibertos, and I've eaten at them all as well as the *berto clones.  The meat never tastes like cat unlike at some of them and it's open 24 hours, inside too!  The condiment bar is always stocked with fresh peppers, tomatoes, salsa, guacamole, etc and they actually get my orders right first try.  If you do go late you may encounter a line at the drive through because it's a hoppin place after everything else closes.",1,positive
I love Ninos......I feel it's authentic Mexican and I am hooked on their Chili Relanos.  I stop for lunch every chance I get.,1,positive
"Love their nachos, since they are loaded with steak, guacamole, cheese, refried beans, etc. etc. They have all the good stuff and you can also share the portion since it's massive! Their stuffed \""""chiles\"""" are delicious and so are their tortas ( I prefer steak, with refried beans, and all the trimmings to go along), topping it off with their horchata. A side bar of sliced fresh veggies is always there, offering you pickled carrots with onions and jalape\u00f1os. I enjoy this place since its cheap and tasty!",1,positive
"Oh Faustos... This place has some amazing food, from bean and cheese burritos to enchiladas to chili relleno to super nachos that truly are \""""super\"""". The food is filling and well priced, with a salsa bar featuring spicy carrots and onions, cucumbers, a red and green salsa, and basket of limes. \n\nBeware, vegetarians, the beans do have lard in them. \n\nMy favorite item is an Egg-Potato-Cheese breakfast burrito that will keep you full for breakfast AND lunch :)",1,positive

"I went to Zuma Grill for lunch, and it was awesome!  I have very high standards for green chile, since I am from New Mexico, and their green chile pork stew was great.

In fact, I signed up for Yelp specifically so I could write a review on the delicious food offered at Zuma Grill.",1,positive
"Whenever the craving for Mexican food hits, I go to this Robertos. The food is consistent and the place is pretty clean. I get one of three things: a California burrito, carne asada nachos, or a breakfast burrito. The nachos are massive so my husband and I usually share. Everything is seasoned well and really fulfills my need for a greasy delicious fix.",1,positive
I love this place. It's cheap and it's yummy. I tried beef/chicken/fish tacos and burritos and none of them let me down. My favorite is the carne asada burrito. It's big enough to fill you up and very delicious.,1,positive
Guacamole bacon jalape\u00f1o burger with mango salsa... tickles my tongue just thinking about it. Chili cheese fries are a guilty pleasure.  Been here a few times and they always have something different on the menu.  It's very clean and the staff is fast and friendly.  Love supporting local businesses!,1,positive
"You really can't go wrong at Chipotle.  I value their commitment to fresh ingredients, and it is a great alternative to fast-food.  I always opt for the vegetarian bowl with brown rice, black beans, grilled peppers, salsa, corn, lettuce, and guacamole.  They are a little on the pricey side given that the meal does not include any chips and salsa.  When we arrived (peak lunch hour) they had run out of brown rice and the people behind me had to settle for white.",1,positive
Roberto's has the best carne asada burritos and the fixin's at the salsa bar are tasty. Red and green sauce and spicy carrots and lime wedges . Also enjoy the 3 rolled tacos with guc .I do agree with some of the reviews about the place being a mess. But that is some of the appeal to most taco shops. I mean risking your life for good tacos and burritos is exciting and I also agree this place is perfect after a late night of drinking.,1,positive
"Our only lunch on this trip was at the Goat Post Tropical Grill on Buffalo Drive.  This is a small unassuming restaurant owned by a couple that serve as waiter (him) and chef (her).  The food spans both the Caribbean and Mexico, but we went with for the Jamaican beef patties, jerk chicken with spicy fries and Jamaican ginger beer soda.  The pastry shell for the patties was amazingly soft and the filling provided enough spice to keep them interesting.  The jerk chicken proved to be spicy, tender and bountiful.",1,positive
The shredded beef burrito and lunch fajitas are really good. A great place to eat lunch.,1,positive
"My husband and I had lunch at Botero this past weekend and it was terrific!  Sat outside by the pool and though much of the bikini scenery worked against an appetite, the food was delicious.  Had a lovely chopped salad with rotisserie chicken, greens and pistachios.  Enjoyed warm tortilla chips with guacamole and salsa.  Husband had some sort of panini and french fries.  Absolutely LOVE the art at Botero!",1,positive
Mexican food is probably my favorite and I really like Lindo.  I will admit that some things are a tad bland like the salsa and beans they serve with the chips but their entrees always make me happy!  I usually get either the chicken enchiladas or the bean and cheese burrito enchilada style smothered with sauce and cheese.  My boyfriend usually gets the veggie fajitas which are also pretty delicious.  The employees have always been pleasant and the place itself is in a nice area of town with awesome views of the strip,1,positive
"New favorite dish here- the Bandeja Genaro! It serves two and is a selection of all the meats they offer (half a chicken, big pieces of grilled steak and pork, 2 different types of sausage) plus two side dishes. At a little over 20 bucks it's a great deal, and we had tons of leftovers. Be sure to try the fried plantains, too!",1,positive
"I'd strongly suggest Taco Tuesdays and/or the shredded beef breakfast burrito.  It's greasy, Mexican fast food so don't go here expecting anything but that.  Their drive thru is super fast and I've always had friendly service at this location.  Don't forget the \""""Del Scorcho\"""" hot sauce!",1,positive
"I love Taza Flores! The place looks good and the terrace is very pleasant in the summer. The service is very friendly and attentive. And everything on the menu is really really good. I've been going for years and it never fails. My favorite are the lamb tajine, the chorizo, the eggplant pizza and the mergez in tomato sauce. It is a bit expensive for the size of the portions, but they put love into it.",1,positive
"The Filiberto's of the West Valley!!! Really like this place! I have been here about three times, get the same old steak and egg burrito, w/beans and potato's! And of course add a little bit of pico! Never been disappointed, a very large serving, and has had very good service. Place looks like its closed down! But it's not, they just blacked the windows to keep the sun out! Family keeps on asking me when I will take them? Soon!",1,positive
"Korean Mexican Fusion...\n\nStarted in LA, expanding across the country. Very well done at KoMex with excellent service. great prices, and the proper divey feel. \n\nThe pork belly, bulgogi, and spicy pork are great, no matter how you have it served. Be sure to have them add kimchi to whatever you order. The meat plates are generously portioned as are the nachos and tacos.\n\nI wish there was one closer to me in San Diego...",1,positive
"Habenero's serves excellent build-to-order burritos and tacos. (Order at the counter, choose your shell, meat, toppings, etc.) The portions were generous, prices reasonable, and the service very good all three times I visited.",1,positive
"Cafe Rio has to have the best chicken burritos there! Everything is so fresh and full of flavor! I get me burrito enchilada style and I definitely recommend that. Everything is fresh and made by hand, like their flour and corn tortillas. Definitely one of my fave places!..:)",1,positive
"Best authentic Mexican food in the East Valley. I'm set in my ways and get the carne asada burrito every time (been going here 6 years), and it has never disappointed. They don't pack your burro full of potatoes or beans, but instead you'll get tons of good beef with the perfect balance of onion and beans. Love the beans. Oh, and regardless the item on the menu, you'll leave VERY full for under $7 bucks.",1,positive
"America's is awesome!  This place is no joke.  My favorites are the Carne Asada, Al Pastor, Bean & Cheese Burrito, and America's Corn.  Everyone I have told about this place loves it...",1,positive
"I get cravings for mexican food. Like a pregnant woman who needs pickles and ice cream, I need my enchiladas with green sauce or else I get cranky. \n\nI've been everywhere around this area and Carambas is the best. It's quick, inexpensive, and delicious. Try it.",1,positive
"Healthy, fast, breakfast food. Not sure why this is such a novel idea.  \n\nSo scrumptious- I crave it even when I'm not in a big hurry. Their breakfast burritos are great. So good that I don't think I've ever ordered anything else. I need to branch out.",1,positive

"Quite possibly the most miserable hotel experience of my life. noisy, dirty, poorly renovated and the WORST customer service known to man.

"I visit Phoenix frequently and this is my first stay at this location. The hotel is marginal, but needs some major updates. The breakfast is less than mediocre and seems like they are always low on supply. The last 2 mornings I arrived to find nothing but crumbs left for eggs. Lastly,  the customer service rep (I wont mention any names) who checked me in needed additional training on how to treat loyal customers. She was very rude and short during check in which I find uncommon for the brand.",0,negative
"This by far, was my worst experience at a hotel...EVER!  Was told we could not congregate in the lobby at all.

Highly recommend never staying here if you have a group of any sort.  Terrible service",0,negative
"Warning!!!  This hotel is directly below the airport's landing pattern. The walls are paper thin and it is NOISY!  On top of that there are major power lines above the pool area and the rooms are outdated without enough electrical outlets.  The kitchen is also terrible, no where near the quality of other hotels claiming to have suites for rooms.  Just a small fridge and microwave.  Paper plates and plastic utensils.  Lousey place.",0,negative
"I stayed here for free one weekend with some friends.  Lets just say even if it was free, I would not stay here again.  The place is just rundown I guess that's part of the whole medieval thing.

Not a very good place to find a nice restaurant or for shopping.",0,negative

After staying at this hotel, my friend got huge rashes all over her body and after speaking to the manager, they didn't even show any sympathy. No apology whatsoever.

Yeah, definitely not coming back here.",0,negative

"Absolutely horrible experience at this Hotel/Casino. The first room (non-smoking) reeked of cigarette smoke and some incredibly nasty fragrance trying to mask it. The second room had a broken bathroom sink. \nThe valet service was extremely slow. They took 30 to 45 minutes to bring\nour bags to the room. The room service food selection is pathetic. Never, never, again. I'm checking out asap, and moving to a different hotel.",0,negative
Wow.. this place is in bad shape. The casino looks ok but Mom and dad stayed there and the rooms blow. I have stayed there a bunch of times over the years but it has went way down hill. I heard they lost their Hilton License and I can guess its because its gotten that bad.,0,negative

"Wow, what a dump, worst one of our trip to Arizona.  Luckily we used airline miles to book this place because it wasn't worth $.  We booked this because we have 2 teenagers with us and could use the extra room of a mini suite.  This room was smaller than the Super8 room and smelled like old cigarettes.  Rude employees.  Noisy location.  \nThe only positive was a decent breakfast.\nWill never come back.",0,negative
"We arrived here yesterday. The rooms are very nice, but the beds are awful!!!! We took 3 separate rooms and all of them had the same problem. It seems like these mattresses had been used forever.... Also, the doors are so heavy that we are constantly concern about our kids fingers; even for an adult its hard to open them. I would not recommend this hotel. Never coming back... We looked for a nice hotel w out cigaret smoke and casino, but this experience is not worth it....",0,negative
"Rooms look beat up. Toilette handle stuck. We requested no fragrance when making our reservation.  We checked in, went to our room and found that it HAD been sprayed with VERY PUNGENT FRAGRANCE. We asked for the manager who denied that they use fragrance on property at all.  Which is a lie. They charged us $100 for the night plus the $20 resort fee. We never even stayed in the room nor took our luggage up. I will never shop in the Miracle Mile shops or go to PH again.",0,negative

ENOUGH!",0,negative
Needs to be updated the rooms are looking dated and walking around after 10 pm is not advised. I paid with Hotwire $65.00 per night but it would have been two double beds. I paid $20.00 more per night for a king with a view of drunk park. Cops look at them and they look at the cops. Still not bad place but not great.,0,negative
"Do NOT book this hotel. They make it up like it's luxury but don't be fooled. Almost no amenities, and so out-dated. Either you demand an upgrade to the \""""presidential suite\"""" or leave because the presidential suites are the only ones that are equivalent to a standard Holiday Inn room.",0,negative
Ok from the moment we arrived to this hotel there was non stop issues! The staff at the main desk was tudy and rude... With a brush off style attitude ... The parking is atrocious and so is the set up! They charge u per day for parking 26$ ! On top of everything they lost my car once and another hockey players dads car as well! Food in the restaurant is decent ... Be careful of there's kids having parties cuz the chaos they make in the halls at 2-3 am is absurd ! Rooms were standard hotel rooms semi clean,0,negative

If you want a good, happy and stress free vacation DO NOT stay at this hotel. They need to educated and retrain their staff.",0,negative

Horrible customer service. This hotel based on customer service should be a TWO STAR hotel. The reservation department is incompetent of their job. Lots of inconsistency. I was just shocked how they couldn't reserve my room when I put down my credit card to guarantee it. Management need to train the whole reservation staff. Trust me every time I called I got a different answer.,0,negative
This place is HORRIBLE.. When checked in hotel was surrounded by 6 police cars and staff would not say whats going on.

With two people...we ended up paying $100 round trip for baggage fees, received extremely rude service, and sat on the return flight for over an hour while they replaced a broken radio (yes, they boarded an entire flight before this was discovered). Please don't make the same mistake we did. Never choose US Airways.",0,negative
"This is the WORST AIRLINE I've flown on in a long time. They're disorganized, rude, and there is very limited seating at their departure gates.

I will avoid this airline at all costs in the future.",0,negative

A word of caution. Try not to fly this airline coming out of Las Vegas to (anywhere) a day or two after New Year's! The line we were all in had at least 400 people in it standing outside...in the chilly air....with all your luggage. Not good!,0,negative
"For an airline today, southwest is pretty good.\nThe free bags (2 per person) are a very nice bonus.\nIf you took 2 bags for each leg of the trip, that would be $100 per person on any other flight! \n\nYou can tell the workers love working for southwest and are some of the funniest flight attendants around!",1,positive
Southwest people suck they didn't let me in when I was right at the door and it was still 10 mins before boarding time. They were too rude and lazy to do their job and let the passengers make their flight. Even their lost and found crew can't even do their jobs right in finding lost items because they said they don't throughly clean their planes after each service. I can't believe how rude the crew is and I will make sure a lot of people don't either.,0,negative
"So, I have a $60.00 credit that SWA has held for a year. I asked them for a refund and their reply was that I needed to book a flight within three days or they keep my money. How cheap can they get? They didn't even offer me an extension for another flight!",0,negative

"Yet again severely disappointed in how US Airways handles their business. Poorly operated, poor customer service representatives, and over-all lack of commitment to the patrons that frequent their business. Yet more delays without a good reason behind them and with no plan in place to resolve said delays. I would recommend paying a higher price for flights with their competitors as at least Delta, Southwest, and United are much easier to work with.",0,negative
The best airline by far! My husband and I flew Virgin America for the first time. This airline makes flying fun and comfortable! Everyone gets a TV with several channels.

This company is doing everything right and we will fly with them for future flights! Excellent job Virgin America! :),1,positive

Us airways is horrible.  Their stewardesses are more concerned with their cell phones than anything else. As the plane was landing people were. Standing in the aisles.

Also a separate dessert room, creme brulee, chocolate covered strawberries! The price per person is $58 isn't bad at all for the quality food you are getting, can't wait to go back.",1,positive
"Absolutely not worth it.  First- the service was inexcusable.  The food was mediocre at best, and for the price we left extremely disappointed.  I am fairly sure that another table just got up and left in the middle of dinner.  I was really surprised at both the service and the food because it looks like a nice place and it is expensive.  I will never eat here again and I am super irritated that I wasted $80 on a crappy meal and crappy service.  I wish I could un-eat the meal.",0,negative
Great buffet lots of selections the prime rib was delicious it was worth the  30 dollars,1,positive
This is like fine dining at a buffet price. There is fresh sushi and salads. I always end up eating 2 of the creme brulees. Of course prime rib and crab legs have a plate of their own.,1,positive
"Very small portions, but good food. Had a perfectly cooked fillet minion, but $60 and they could have served with a toothpick, it was so small.  \nSame for rest of our party. Excellent salmon, but maybe 5 bites again $60. \nEverything is a la carte so sides extra. Thai papaya salad good, and key lime pie great.",0,negative
Way over priced for the quality and taste of the food. I'm happy to pay a lot of money for any exceptional meal but our anniversary dinner was mediocre at best. The service was so-so too. Luckily we were able to sit were we could watch the Bellagio fountains.,0,negative
"I returned this past weekend with my bff and this place was great again!  We rolled in about 2am.  I had the chicken flautas, my friend had their rustic veggie pizza.  We loved both dishes and they were so big, definitely big enough for sharing.  Prices are great (most dishes between $10-$12) and the food is so good you will want to go back to try new things!  Instead of hitting buffets or Denny's after a late night or daytime after the pool, try this place. ;-)",1,positive
"The check in offer just can't be beat.  My Sis and I came in for a lunch together, she ordered the wedge, I wanted to lettuce wraps (check in offer), we both had tea. Huge amazing salads and yummy tea, teeeny tiny bill, under $20!!",1,positive
"The portions are enormous! It was a bit of a wait before we could be seated, but it was worth the wait! The food was delicious and far beyond your normal restaurant selections. The staff was super friendly and knowledgeable.  \n\nIt's a little pricey, but no more than a night at Outback Steakhouse.",1,positive
"The best item to order isn't even on the menu: the tasting menu.  I didn't know about this secret the first time I ate there and had wound up ordering the sea bass, which I found to be overly hyped.  The tasting menu consists of a multi-course meal of items selected by the chef depending on your food preferences and your price point ($60-$120 per person).  If you're in town for a short time and don't see yourself visiting again any time soon, the tasting menu is what to request!",1,positive
"Oyster Bar combo pan roast, $24.  A  discordant mish mash of spiced up odds and ends with about 4 big shrimps thrown in.   I don't get it?  What's so great?  I think it costs 2 or 3 times what it should.  Slightly odd slightly smirky server.  Inside a casino.  I thought it was slightly weird, but then I think the whole Las Vegas scene is weird.",0,negative
"Steak and eggs for 3.99, u can't beat that in the morning. Especially starting out on a trip back to L.A.   We enjoyed our meals here.  In order to get 3.99 steak & eggs you have to get a players card at the desk.  It's free.  We will definetly be back.",1,positive
"Boyfriend & I got 2 meals for $11.\n\nThat's about all I can say about this place. The food is basically fast food diner style. I probably would only go here if I wanted to be waited on. Or if I was 16 and wanted to go on a date (there were several cute little couples here, on Valentines day!).",0,negative
"I get to go here about once a month for educational dinners.  I have never paid so don't ask about pricing.  I have had their filet mignon which is pretty good, calamari which is ok, scallops which aren't really my thing, sour dough bread which was fantastic, amazing stuffed mushrooms.  The vegetables are perfectly cooked and the mashed potatoes are great.  At the end we get the chocolate mousse cake that really ends the night well.  I have enjoyed every meal I have eaten there.",1,positive
Super Great Food!!! The prices are not too shabby... My one flaw is the timelyness if your looking for a quick bite not the place or I suggest ordering before you come. (The food kinda takes a hot minute but it is worth it!!!) I've brought plenty of friends and they all love it. I also used them to cater my big 3-0!! Again everyone loved it!! Doesn't really matter what you order I've tried everything and it all agrees with my palate! Cheers!,1,positive
Okay buffet. I was had a hangover and didnt have much of a appetite. Ate one small plate. We came as lunch was still being converted. Breakfast was all your typical items. Lunch had Pho. Dessert was lots of variety. $23 or so but we was in a group so got hit with gratuity and tax. Came to about $30. One plate for $30. Sounds good haha,0,negative
"Wow. For my husband's birthday we enjoyed a self selected 21 item dinner for $130. It was amazing. First we started with a Saki sampler - who knew Saki came in more flavors that green apple?!? After the saki we very delicious items to include crispy fried chicken, grilled duck breast, daikon, grilled tomato and asparagus, pork cheek, lamb chop... Omg, the list goes on and ends with a great chocolate lava cake! Awesome waiter, Andrew, and friendly staff.",1,positive
"I usually come in here for cheap take-out, where they give you a reasonably sizable box and soup container to fill up with buffet items.  You can be stingy or you can just pig out and stuff as much as you can fit without cheating into the containers.  I usually make a bee-line for the premium stuff like the sushi, which quickly recoups the take-out costs.",1,positive
"Took the family...The portions were generous & the food was great. I recommend it, if in the area.",1,positive
"Having dinner at Studio B buffet.  For $40 a person, I am very disappointed.  There's a tiny section for sushi (one plate and some rolls) and there are only 2-3 kinds.  The Osso Bucco is as hard as leather.  Pad Thai too spicy.  Crab legs are very thin and hardly have any meat.  Oysters and shrimp are ok.  One Plus is that beer and wine are included.  I just don't think the price is worth it.  Will definitely not be back.",0,negative
Sunday buffet for $13 all you can eat and drink.,1,positive
"The portions are HUGE!\nCame here for breakfast and the omelets are ginormous! They were very filling and tasty as well! I might just share one next time. \nThe Frozen Hot Chocolate was good as well, but pretty overpriced. \nI believe there was a coupon in the booklet they gave us when we checked in at Planet Hollywood, but we didnt see it until after we left.",1,positive
"$35 for brunch, fewer selections of food than Bellagio's buffet. The quality of food is Okay, Not that great of taste. Not worth the money paid.",0,negative
"Went for Restaurant week on 9/21, the food and presentation were good.  Most unhappy that they added a gratuity of 29% for a party of 4.  Absolutely ridiculous and will not go back.",0,negative
AWESOME DEAL !!!!\n\nI got this this past weekend and it was worth every penny.\n\nGot to eat about 4 buffets and it was great.,1,positive
This is very approachable high-end food and well worth the price. The five course tasting menu with a glass of wine gets you out at about \u00a380. Try to leave room for the cheese if you can - it looks divine but it's hard to squeeze in after deceptively filling courses.,1,positive
"I wish I could remember what the food tasted like. But my boyfriend liked it, so I'm giving them 4 stars for this review. His favorite item from wicked spoon was the bone marrow. \""""It was so amazing\"""" \nHaha\n\nThe plating and presentation of the food was appetizing and appealing too. \n\nThe cost per person was about $45-50 a person. \nI would definitely come back here again, this time sober. Hahha",1,positive
"The $20.12 lunch special here is amazing! It's a 3 course meal from a fixed menu. For a small additional price, you can upgrade the main course to a lobster spaghetti. it was amazing! i will definitely be back next time im in vegas =)",1,positive
"I guess the prices are what they are because it's at the Wynn? The food was good, but a little overpriced IMO, even for tapas. It was $13 for 4 small bacon-wrapped dates. The rest of what we ordered was pretty good and fairly priced. The pesto pasta was delicious! The flatbread was filling and definitely tasty. I forget the name of the one we got, but it had artichokes and ricotta cheese...yummm!! I would definitely go back for the flatbread!",1,positive
"My wife and I go to lunch here every week. The Ashley and the other servers already know our drink orders. The menu a big and varied. Breakfast, appetizers, burgers, salads, wraps, paninis, and other other good stuff. The prices are outsanding. Two lunch entrees and two drinks for well under $20. This is a great place that anyone can enjoy. I usually get a salad with grilled chicken, but the Carolina Club is my favorite.",1,positive
My wife and I both had the HK tasting menu which at first I thought might be a little over priced but I was wrong! Every course was excellent. \nMeal consisted of:\nAmuse Bouche - Scotch Egg\nFirst course - Beet Root Salad\nSecond course - Scallop Risotto\nThird course - Roasted Beef Wellington\nDessert course - Sticky Toffee Pudding\n \nFYI...Still water is not complimentary and you will have to pay for it.,1,positive
A lot of cash for not a lot of food.  The food tasted ok but I paid $28 bucks for a ribeye that was as thin as a burger at a fast food joint.  The have way to many items on the menu and the waiter couldnt answer simple questions about any of the items from out party of 6.,0,negative
"Came here for a quick bite to eat at the bar. \n\nFood: \nyellow tail jalapeno: melts in your mouth, highly recommend $24, 6 pieces\nrock and roll shrimp tempura: a bowl of shrimp tempura drown in delicious sauce and it had mixed greens at the bottom. this was also 20 something. \n\npeach Belini was refreshing and delicious. 5 gulps and it was in my liver for processing. \n\nEverything was cooked to perfection if I had more money I would eat here for a meal. our bill came out to be $92 with two drinks too.",1,positive
"So my husband and I decided to try thus place out, since we found a great deal on Groupon and the yelp reviews were good. The groupon deal was $32 for an alcohol beverage, a choice of burger or sandwich,  with fries or a salad. This is really a good deal and the food was super yummy.  I definitely plan on coming back here in the near future.  They have daily happy hour deals & reverse happy hour too. Awsome atmosphere to take a group of friends or family or even date night.  The servers are fast and friendly.",1,positive
"Not a lot to say other than great southern comfort food. Good fried chicken, great beef ribs. Small servings of ribs, but great flavor. Loved the collard greens and coconut cake. I'd go back. Definately worth trying.",1,positive
"Mert's is true southern soul food.  Not the New American type, but the real stuff.  Mac-n-cheese, green beans cooked in animal fat, salmon cakes, fried chicken.  It's all good.  I love the mac-n-cheese and will often just order a veggie plate where I can pick 4 different ones to eat.  They always have vegetable specials so I can try something new every time I go.  \n\nThey also had 4 different hot sauces on the table.  I made a point to sample them all on the delicious corn bread they make.",1,positive
"I first went to Merry Ann's the night I craved The Home Stretch Haystack. Merry Ann's version paled in comparison. I gave them another shot a few weeks later, this time for lunch.  I ordered a blue plate special, country fried steak, mashed potatoes and gravy, and peas. The country fried steak patty was chopped formed, deep fried, and covered with a gravy dry mix, which also covered the potatoes. The peas were from a can. Haven't eaten there since.",0,negative
"I went there for lunch with my boyfriend. We are both cajun food fans. We ordered the spinach artichoke dip with crab. I ordered jambalaya, and he ordered the combination plate. They were all edible but not very pleasing to the palate. The  staff was nice, but the main entries took almost an hour to come out. It was pretty disappointing. I don't think I would come back.",0,negative
"I'm sitting here right now enjoying my country fried chicken! Its really yummy. The gravy is also very tasty. This vanilla mr. Pibb is vanilla as vanilla can be. Im all around pleased. The service is good, food is good and the ambiance hits the diner feel spot on.",1,positive
"So many better places on Spring Mountain.  One dish tastes likes the next at this joint.  The \""""white\"""" chicken is anything but.  Cathay was once one of the best in town.  Not any more.  As they say, \""""no more business from me to you!\""""",0,negative
"The very best Turkey and Dressing I have Ever had (sorry, Mom!). The turkey was tender and moist, and along with the delicious stuffing and gravy, practically melted in my mouth.  I love that they're open so late! The wait staff were very attentive and helpful.  Huge menu, beautiful house-made desserts.  I look forward to eating there again next time I'm in Charlotte.",1,positive
I've grown up on Roscoe's Chicken in waffles but I enjoyed this place so much more. Plus you don't smell like chicken when you leave Score!,1,positive
Fantastic chicken and waffles! Cornbread was perfect and the koolaid was just like as a kid! Fun atmosphere and good value! Would go back!,1,positive
"The chicken fried chicken is great and so is the open faced turkey sandwich. They give large portions, and the ranch at the salad bar is one of the best I've tasted... I specifically come back for the open face turkey, chicken fried chicken, and ranch at the salad bar...",1,positive
Great food! I have been to one of the other locations on Southern and both are amazing! My favorites are the seared ahi with hummus and the grilled vegetable entr\u00e9e!,1,positive
"chicken fried steak, biscuits, hash.... all in an authentic diner setting.   Perfect.",1,positive
Been coming here every Tuesday with the family for 2 years know always drive through . Fried chicken mild just the skin will make your knees buckle. Chicken always perfection juicier then a gallon of Tampico and seasoned to make you eat till you go into a fried chicken coma.... 2 pieces of fried chicken for .99\u00a2 can't beat it!,1,positive
Bobby flays place is exactly what'd you'd expect from the southwest flavor king. I ordered the corn tortilla soup and man it was spicy and delicious!  For the main I got the spiced pork tenderloin sandwich. Definitely a must try. You have to come to his place with the expectation that everything will have his signature kick to it. \n\nI came on a Tuesday day time and there was still a small wait for lunch. I recommend calling in a reservation if you're dinning in for dinner.,1,positive
"This is my favorite chicken strip place!! OMG I LOVE IT HERE!! I wish they had one in los angeles, so sad. But yeah everything here is BOMB!!! From their tasty toast to their sweet tea, OMG MADE TO PERFECTION. Can't leave out the chicken strip.. ooo la la.. i loveeeeeee it.. I think I want to move to vegas just for this restaurant. lol.. but yeah their sweet tea is better than mcdonalds. wayyy better. it has the right sweetness, delisssssssshh!! omg i just love it. LOVEEE YOUUU CANES!!",1,positive
"The Cane's sauce goes great with everything -  fries, chicken fingers.  Love the toast! Love love the sweet tea! However, this location is very busy as it is in a tourist-y area -  being on LV Blvd and in the same shopping complex as the outlet mall.  If you prefer a less busy location, try the ones that are more local!  They have several close by.",1,positive
"Holy crap this place is so damn good! I'm still dreaming of their reuben sandwhiches all the way from Austin, TX. This is a must eat!",1,positive
"I have probably eaten here close to 30 times over the past few years.  Even after all of those meals I can't remember either myself, or the people I have eaten with, being disappointed.  And for those of you who haven't tried the restaurant yet, or for those of you who don't like to make many decisions for yourselves, here you go: start with the AZ egg rolls, order the Cajun chicken sandwich for your main course, and then chase all of that with a fresh baked apple pie for dessert.",1,positive
"Best chicken fingers I've had.  Other options in the Valley can get close (i.e. Raising Cane's) but this place is unparalleled.\n\nThis is a really small place, about as local as it gets - so feel good about spending your money here!  Talk up the owner and bring your friends - he'll hook you up with extra sauce or an extra finger.",1,positive
"This place was off the hook with Flavor. Takes a while to get the fried chicken as they cook to order. Very rustic place, it is family owned.  The mixed greens were SOOO full of Flavor and the Black eyed peas were some of the best I've ever had. I left there totally stuffed. Nice portions. Many NFLers, MLBers, and musicians have signed the walls. Cool reading.",1,positive
This is by far best place for chicken and oxtails.  Great food and customer service. Better than lo Lo chicken and waffles,1,positive
"This no frills joint has been on my list for years. I keep it simple every time. Jambalaya or Gumbo over rice extra crackers. When I am jonesing for the New Orleans flavor this is my spot. It gives The Oyster Bar at Palace Station a run for their money. It could use a little swagger, but I don't go there to party.",1,positive
"Came here for some jerk chicken and it was delish.  Great flavor and not too spicy.  The rice and peas were okay, a little dry and they were like rice and red beans not black eyed peas that I'm used to.  The cabbage salad was good.  The beef patties were amazing and big for $2.00..Also tried the cupcakes yummy. I would def come back when I'm back in town.",1,positive
"Excellent greasy spoon, I can see why this place has so many faithful regulars. The service is as outstanding as the food, cooked exactly how you want it just like food cooked at home would be. Every time I go I feel so welcomed, it's like visiting my grandparent's for breakfast.",1,positive
"Sadies has THE BEST fried chicken I have ever had.\nGreat fried okra,mac & cheese and waffles also.",1,positive
"Made my first trip to Bojangles while visiting Charlotte this past weekend... I LOVE biscuits and this was clearly the place to go for that! I ordered some chicken, mac & cheese, a plain biscuit, and 2 cinnamon biscuits... the best part of the meal was clearly the biscuits... other food was just ok.  I love these biscuits, especially those heavenly cinnamon biscuits!",1,positive
"Wow. Love this place. We had the soul food plate with chicken fried chicken, collared greens, and beans on rice. We could have drank the white gravy from a cup it was so good. The service was fantastic and she answered all our questions. (We're as pasty white as it gets and this one of the first soul food experiences for the family.) One tip: the portions are huge so you can share. Highly recommend.",1,positive
"Blackened catfish grits, shrimp grits, crawpuppies - everything here is amazing, and Abita to boot! I've eaten my way through NOLA's best, oldest and most well-known eateries and Lola's has it down. She  refuses to buy shrimp from anywhere but the gulf, and orders bread from the big easy too, and the attention to detail shows. My growing gut hates Lola's, but my tastebuds love it!",1,positive
"First time there, and the fried chicken was one of the best I have had.  The sides of mashed potatoes and gravy, with biscuits, were less than stellar, however.  Nevertheless, the staff was friendly, and the chicken was great.",1,positive
"Went to Beauregard on a Saturday night as they were featuring a crawfish boil for $15. It was a great deal with crawfish, sausage, shrimp, potatoes, shrooms and corn all in the pot, and all you can eat. \n\nGood traditional Nawlins flavors and spice, washed down with an Abita Turbo Dog. \n\nTheir menu is a bit limited and is a blend of Cajun and Southern. The best bet appears to be their daily specials, from Red Beans and Rice on Mondays to short ribs on Saturdays.",1,positive
The food at Old country has been excellent every time I go there.  I highly recommend this restaurant.,1,positive

"Legit one of my fav spots to eat... Anyplace that can offer me unencumbered chicken skin gets an A+++ in my book. \nThis is a great spot to sample a little bit of this and a little bit of that which is how i personally like to roll! Pork Belly, Chicken thighs, Chicken Skin and Bacon wrapped asparagus.. I think I wanna be buried here. Yeah.. thats right its that good!! \nI drive all the way from centennial hills just to get some of this deliciousness! I will most \ncertainly be back to Kyara.",1,positive

"Everyone is very nice in Raising Cane's.\nTaste is really average, nothing even close to famous chicken finger.",0,negative
"Went to Raising Canes today. First I have to say the place was clean and the staff was nice. I had  the Box which consisted of 4 chicken fingers, fries, coleslaw,toast and drink. The chicken was hot and not too greasy and seemed pretty fresh, but bland bland and more bland !! The sauce was okay but no real spice or flavor, need more choices in sauces, fries soggy not fresh, frozen and not cooked well, coleslaw out of a box not fresh. In my opinion it was very expensive for the quality of food. Won't be back.",0,negative
"Completed our 3rd trip here within 4 months. This trip included their awesome Veggie Fries with the addition of the Cajun Wings. As other people have stated VERY good wings.\n  This recent trip I decided to try the house special \""""Sweet Meat\"""" Burger... Wow!   What a unique and tasty flavor combination. The glazed donut type bun and sweet onion mayo along with Angus burger and smokey bacon?!?!  Happiness!!  Great beers and our waiter was terrific as always! We love this place!!",1,positive
I just ate here with my husband and my in-laws and it was hands down the BEST fried chicken I have EVER had! Super crispy and tasty on the outside and yummy and juicy on the inside. And we got 8 BIG pieces of chicken and 2 slices of cornbread for $10.99- such a deal! The owners were so kind and welcoming and we enjoyed visiting with them. The collared greens were perfect- nice and crisp- and the sweet potato pie was delish. I am HIGHLY recommending Ezekiel's to anyone who will listen to me. We'll be back.,1,positive
People from Chicago truly appreciate the pleasure of seeing  Garretts  now in other places. We love them and just wish we could get them to Dallas!  Its pricey for ordinary popcorn but this isnt ordinary so it's woth the couple extra bucks.  Tip...if you put in the  freezer what you want to save for later. It definitely works. We stock up and have later!,1,positive
Great Southwestern fried chicken. Some other stuff on the menu looks really good. Staff are sometimes nice.,1,positive
"This was my first time at a Raising Cane.  The employees were super friendly and welcoming.  They rate 5 stars!  The food, however, was disappointing.  Even though the chicken was very moist and tender, it lacked any special flavor.  It needs some seasoning.  The fries were on the dry, stale side, but the bread and coleslaw were very good.  The next time I'm hungry for chicken, I'll stick with KFC with a choice of side dishes.",0,negative
Good fish & chips. Highly recommend the Cajun seasoning. Right on a busy road where you'd almost miss it but it's a little spot worth a visit.,1,positive
"Review about this place were right, BIG portions! Off the strip but only about 10 minutes away from the end of the strip. We ordered the Corned Beef Hash breakfast, a pancake, and an omelette\nThe Corned Beef Hash came with potato crisps, very flavorful and tasted just baked, not soggy at all.\nI ordered the banana bread instead of toast, was pretty tasty! The servers were nice and attentive, only when we paid was there a wait, but no biggie to me.\nOverall, food was good and the price just as good.",1,positive
"Was there Saturday night and was able to walk in with no reservations.   Appetizers were great.  Ordered the filet but was under cooked.  The waiter took it back but came back stil undercooked.  Other than that, all the rest of food was awesome.  Staff was friendly.   Manager took of the filet of the bill and then offered us coffee and desert on the house.  Went the extra mile to make sure we were happy.  Nice place away from heavy traffic of the strip.  Will be back.",1,positive
"Guy was right.  The 'boli's are awesome.  We got a large veggie and a meatball and that was enough for the 4 of us (granted, one is a 14 year old girl...).  The beer was extra cold and went down really smooth after the 4 hour flight into the 105 degree afternoon.  The place is truly a dive, but worth the trip off to the north side.  If you're on the south half of the strip it might not be worth the cab fare, but if you have a rental like us it is worth the drive.",1,positive
"This place has been a personal family tradition for over 40 years. From the days when you could order their'steak that's not on the menu' for under $9.00, to the raved BBQ Baby Back Ribs, to their NY pizza joint. The food is abundant, inexpensive, and good. 'The place for the locals', the payouts are great, and the vibe is kickback from the craziness hoopla from the Strip. Their legendary karaoke room has been around longer than the fad itself. A strong recommend for any tourist who.wants something other than the Strip.",1,positive
One of mine and my wifes favorite places on the strip. Many games and places to eat inside many good shows going on all the time fun place.,1,positive
"A perfect breakfast spot on the Strip.  Recently returned and was thrilled even more, so hence the 5 stars!  Actually took advantage of their under $10 make-your-own bloody Mary bar.  Olives, pickled veggies and even beef sticks!!  What a perfect idea!  I love my friend Gabi!",1,positive
Pretty great Mexican food for a Hotel on the strip. The cheese enchiladas were delicious!,1,positive
Great place to have a casual meal on the strip - -two outside levels that overlook the strip plus the indoor eating area also-- your choice! \nGood show inside at dinnertime also.  Dancer who goes down the volcano and into a blender!  I have eaten off the menu and all  is good!  Get the conch fritter appitizer !,1,positive
"Very good buffet. Tied with Bellagio in my book for best on the strip. The food is very'saucy' and that sauce tends to be very similar - it's still buffet food afterall. It's also kinda' cute with it's little village inside and their attempt to make regional foods under the region signs (ok, not authentic at all but still). \n\nI am tempted to give it just 3 stars for the horrible lines that normally await you there. Definitely try for an off time and a bit of luck...",1,positive
"What a FUN little country nook in the heart of the strip!  We came here for a nice hearty \""""meat n potatoes\"""" dinner, unaware of the cute cowgirls and the country dancefloor!  Ended up sitting at the bar to eat our nachos and burger (which became our dinner).  Enjoyed conversation with some cowboys sitting down the bar from us.  Ended the country escapade with some from our group attempting to line dance on our way out of the place!  As fun as it gets... and yes, I did get it on video!  :)~",1,positive
"I like the atmosphere, but food was just okay. We had a view of the strip as we ate, which I loved. I really wish the food was just as great. Is wasn't bad, but just okay. I don't know if I would eat here again.",0,negative
"Not that far off the strip rests one of the greatest breakfasts you've ever had. We went at about 10:30 and had to wait for about 45 minutes, but it was worth it. Ordered the Andy's sage fried chicken. It was amazing. \n\nStarts off with mashed potatoes, then two great biscuits on top of that. Then comes the delicious crispy fried chicken with tons of scrambled eggs on top, a grilled piece of cheese, and then the chipotle hollandaise sauce. I left the place being one of the most food-drunks I've ever been.",1,positive
Recommended by a friend and it did not disappoint.  We went there for breakfast.  The portions are sizeable (I had the French Toast and had trouble finishing the meal).  They serve a mean Bloody Mary.  You will have to drive to get there; by car it is a good 20 minute car drive from the strip.  But well worth the journey.,1,positive
"Best value in buffet dinner at the south end of the Strip.   INCLUDES wine and beer, as well as good dessert bar.  TOM, the waiter, is the best waiter there ... Great service, ask for him.",1,positive
"This place was AMAZING. Up until I went to Stripsteak my favorite steak place was Cut by Wolfgang puck. But, given that everything here was amazing (the appetizers, main meal, sides AND desert) it is an overall winner and now at the top of my list. I'm just sad that it is in Vegas and not in LA. Also - I figured it was about $200 less than Cut for the same meal / alcohol combo. Be sure to get the donuts with dipping sauce at the end of the night!",1,positive
Such yummy drinks and great prices! I would def. recommend stopping here if your on the strip!,1,positive
"I loved this place! A few tips...arrive early if possible to have the best selection of open tables. Ask for the South side which has a better strip view. If it's not too hot outside you can request an outside table that has the best view of the strip. I got a $50 discount so it was a lot more affordable. Cocktails are about $16 each, so if you want to save money go for a glass of wine or no alcohol. I wrote about how I got my discount in my blog if you want more info letsjetset.com.",1,positive
"Excellent food, interesting menu selections and a nice local experience.\n\nThe food was tasty with what seems to be a focus on healthiness. Several items come with egg whites but are super tasty!   \n\nA 10-15 minute trip from the strip.  It's nice to see normal prices.\n\nFood: 9/10\nService: 8/10\nCleanliness: 9/10\nPrices 7.5 /10",1,positive
"Stripburger is the perfect spot to dine if you want a fun, outdoor, street-cafe (with full bar!) setting on the Strip. The burgers are solid, the onion strings are addictive, and the shakes are out of sight.  You can always find a place to sit, (been there dozens of times and never had to wait,) and convenient parking at Fashion Show's underground garage.  After we list Trader Vic's at Miracle Mile, this is the spot to enjoy a desert night with friends looking to take in the sights.",1,positive
"Ive walked by this joint a few times as i drunken walk towards the center of the strip... So finally decided to walk in the waitress was very nice (dont remember her name) long story short happy hour $4 - 32 oz domestic beer, happy hour nachos feeds 2 were good would definetly go back",1,positive
"Awesome experience, food, and value anywhere you go.  We came here at the spur of the moment after learning that they were here.  I've been to many in the L.A. area this one is just as good.  The wait took awhile but there's a constant stream of people coming to eat.  it's not entirely walkable from the strip as most people simply drive or cab it, but it is possible.  Had two double doubles and fries animal style!  Yum!",1,positive
Good buffet for family's. Everyone crying about it but you should know the better buffets are down the strip. \nFast clearing our plates hot fresh food on a Friday. \nBad thing is drinks like oj n apple juice is warm and with ice it gets water down.,1,positive
"This was my 2nd time here. Raku is probably the best restaurant I've ever been to! It's so much better than anything on The Strip. Some favorites include the sea urchin cold dish, sashimi specials, and pork cheek and pork ear skewers. The specials board can be a bit spendy, but I've never been disappointed. Save room for dessert at Snowflake shavery in the same parking lot--the perfect ending to a perfect meal.",1,positive
"Great ambiance. Great people. Great time.\n\nWe were there mid-March for a wine tasting. It was a little early into a Thursday night, but fun nonetheless. These guys have a nice little patio overlooking the strip.\n\nI would recommend Lavo for a warm-up drink, matched w/ a good cigar.",1,positive
"This place is a dive came here because of yelp reviews and was a little disappointed, \n I walked in to find it a very small square bar with only a couple tables. You have to order at bar and drinks run $9 if you like tiki souvenir cup it will cost you $25 each.\nNow the drinks were very strong but also very good. It's located way off the strip closer to freemont.",1,positive
"This Walgreens is in the perfect location for all the tourists passing through the strip.  You can get anything here, even fresh fruit for your cocktails and souveniers that don't cost you an arm and a leg!  Nice and clean inside, organized and very helpful when you're \""""trapped\"""" in Sin City!",1,positive
"We sat outside to enjoy The Strip view and were treated to a good, quick lunch. We ordered food and in less than 10 minutes it was at our table. Amazing. Try the tacos al carbon platter, street tacos on corn tortillas with fresh ingredients and nice spices.\n\nThe wait staff was laid back and cool. A great view and a nice meal.",1,positive
Location is awesome for people watching if you sit along the elevated glass railing overlooking the strip. My wife and I sat outside but near the inside of the restaurant. I was not impressed with the food but the location was amazing. The food was just ok I thought by the restaurant sitting on the sidewalk on the strip in front of the Miracle Mall I expected more. I did like the mist sprays to cool the air.,0,negative
burgers were amazing and our waitress was so nice. there was a beer pong place inside and a bull it was awesome to hang out and its very laid back and chill for being on the strip.,1,positive
Great ny strip with a French twist \nVery friendly service,1,positive
Place is really random off the strip but is freaking amazing.,1,positive
"Hot damn!! Really good BBQ!! Get in there!! Brisket was too good!! Love that Mac n cheese too!! Off the strip, but sooo fricken good!!! Well worth the trip!!!\nGoing back for more the 2nd night",1,positive
"Love this place.....unpretentious, fun and reminds me of NYC.  Make sure to order \""""THE DOUGIE\"""" french dip sandwich which pairs great with a dirty martini.  The five stars is for being my favorite place to go after a weekend pool party...I can keep my sunglasses on and max out the best bar food on the strip without worrying about judgement. Ask for Declan or Jon.",1,positive
"Great option if you want good food and a low hassle restaurant that's on the strip. The burgers were decent, but we just wanted a quick meal that wasn't at a fast food chain or a high end restaurant. Location can't be beat. There was a short wait though, maybe five to ten minutes.",1,positive
"Awesome food, awesome service. The best way to do teppanyaki without breaking the bank or having to drive down to the strip. We have been here many times for birthdays, Mother's Day, etc. I highly recommend Eddy!",1,positive
"Honestly, i am surprised by some of the reviews...\n\n Great food. Great service. Jason was our server and made our experience very fun! Great price point for the strip as well. \n\nWe will be back!",1,positive
"Cheapest drinks on the Strip.  Guys playing beer pong at the foot court and LOUD 70's music, surly bartenders, but two martinis for $6 can't be beat!",1,positive
"This was a great cool addition to the strip.  A mini strip all with restaurants, bars and shops.  This is where you find the \""""High Roller Ferris Wheel\"""".  The Linq is located between Harrah's and Flamingos and the Quad.  The Bolt bus station is also located here, near the Ferris Wheel.  I'm happy to see a Ghiradelli's ice cream shop here.",1,positive
My family and I have gone to this location several times and the wait has never been too long and the food has always been doggy bag worthy...,1,positive

Sitting in the drive thru long enough to write a review. First I waited long enough that by the time I got up to the box to order bfast was over. Since I have ordered I have been waiting.. At the box......  For 9 min!!! If you are not ready to serve lunch then serve what you got! Still have not moved by the way,0,negative
"Came in Saturday, a little after 5:00, very few customers and plenty of staff. We sat for several long minutes before they finally figured out who would serve us. The food came quickly, and was hot but just adequate. The lobster ravioli tasty fishy and the chicken was dry. It had been a long time since we had been to a Macaroni Grill. We see no reason to rush back.",0,negative
Waited over 30 minutes for our food. Was it worth it? Nope. Food didn't have any taste I had to season myself.  I don't think I wanna come back again. Poor server was really nice. But What's up with the kitchen? What a shame.,0,negative
90 minutes for 3 people to get breakfast... It took 20 minutes to get our drinks and an hour for our food. The beers we tried were good and the food was solid but based on the service I definitely won't be back to this location. It was not super busy and there was plenty of staff and we couldn't see what the extreme delay was all about.,0,negative
"Waited 1 hour 45 minutes and eventually cancelled the order.  You'd think they'd want to get the food out faster for delivery since our bill was $60.  The guy on the phone didn't even apologize.  I've eaten here before and the food is average.  I will never go back or order out from here again, period.",0,negative
This place was an ordering disaster. No one seemed to know what was going on.  The food was just as good as any other Wendy's.  Don't go here unless you have a lot of patience and time to waste.  The manager did apologize for the wait and stopped by our table to check on us.,0,negative
"It was a busy Saturday night.  We waited about half an hour to get seated, which was fine.  The food was good, but the SERVICE, was what makes it a true 5-star experience.  The mussels & and the flan were probably my favorite.. the octopus was a bit over cooked but still tasted alright.  I highly recommend this place!!",1,positive
"My experience with the King and I restaurant was disappointing all around. On a Tuesday night, my two entrees and one side took an hour and a half to get to my house, even though the estimated delivery time for my order was 50 minutes. Once the food arrived, I was further disappointed that I was brought egg rolls instead of spring rolls. I hate egg rolls. I would not recommend this restaurant.",0,negative
"My boyfriend and i went there for an ayce quick lunch, food was decent wait time for the food was horrible. The place wasn't busy there was 2 couples other then myself and my boyfriend there. We ordered.....20 minutes later we got 2 rolls. The rolls were good so, we decided to order some more..... waited another 25-30 minutes. Food was okay not worth the wait though. So our quick lunch turned into a really long production. Probably will not go back.",0,negative
"Glad I wasn't in a hurry. Took about 75 min. To get our food. The table of 8 who gave there order got food their food 30min before us. We had great view patio seat, but something not right with how kitchen is run.",0,negative
The sandwich with eggs and bacon was amazing! I think the wait was too long and next time I will order to go but I will definitely stop by again!  They should put tables outside instead of having all of the seats for waiting outside!,1,positive
Long wait (40 minutes) on a Friday morning. Guess it's due to limited seating capacity. But the Five Spot and home fries were delicious!,1,positive
"There is a LONG wait here, so if your are in a hurry or starving go somewhere else. I ordered the cobb salad that was HUGE and wonderful! The applewood smoked bacon made it....huge hunks of eggs and avocados. It's a cute little place, but be patient and don't be a clean freak....I ordered coffee and water & could see \""""stuff\"""" like lip marks on both...it was interesting!",1,positive
"Seriously, I had to wait too long for my food. I was starving and come on we ordered hot dogs. It shouldn't take too long to make a hot dog right? Especially if I there was no fixings on it. The hot dog was average, nothing I would come back for. I think I could make a better hot dog at home. I do have to say that I did enjoy their chili fries. I don't think the food was worth the wait or the price.",0,negative
"Long wait, but great food.\nI can't hold a grudge on our wait time, since I was one in a group of ten. We waited about 45 minutes and I will just consider that fair for a place that packed. \nThe food was simple, tastey, and so filling. Only one of our our ten finished a meal completely.\nAlso, booze in the morning with no judgement... which is nice.",1,positive
Food arrived cold and took a very long time; not very impressed. The best part about this place is the waitresses wearing chaps.,0,negative
"we made a reervation and still had to wait an hour, This place sucks. The chicken was dry and had barely any jus on it. The steaks sucked and everything was very bland and not flavorful. Service sucked too. I recommend stk or boa. This place should shut down. Way over rated.",0,negative
"Not instant, but prompt service, and the waitress was perky and friendly. Decent food--Shepherd's Pie was good. If I lived nearby I'd go back. Liked the decor.",1,positive
"Unless you check your order and like cold \""""Hot \"""" Food then this place is for you.  NOT ME !  Three chefs in the kitchen and no one knows what there are doing !

"Never had a bad expereinece. \nAlways fresh.\nWait times can be a little long, but it is worth the wait for the fresh food.",1,positive
"Such a bad ass restaurant. DO NOT GO HERE!!\nIf they say the waiting time is 10 minutes it is for at least for an hour. If you try to make a complain of their information they will say \"""" how the hell do I know when they leave?\"""" They think they are serving you for a free. They will treat you like a dirt.",0,negative
Requested the Mac and cheese vegetarian and got a meat plate.  Then not checked on for 10 minutes and then had to wait for a new order.  F this place.  If given the choice of any other restaurant.  You should choose another place.  I waited almost an hour for some macaroni and cheese.  I could have drove home and made some kraft in a box for how long this isht took.,0,negative
"I've been here a couple times and will always return.\n\nLine waits are usually never that long.\n\nI always get the Italian sandwich, no cheese. Super good, but you must eat right away or the dressing will make it a little soggy.\nTheir Mac salad is ok. The pasta salad is kind of bland. I wouldn't recommend things from the cold case in front for these reasons. \n\nDeducting a star because my sister said her prime rib sandwich was dry and they over charged us for the pasta salad.",1,positive
Went in at 4:30. It was not busy at all but we waited 30 minutes for our drinks. The appetizers were out before the drinks. No reason for it.  The food was decent. Humus plate was good but shrimp cocktail was over cooked.  Would not return.,0,negative
"Went at about lunchtime on a Sunday, and there was only about a five minute wait. This is a busy little place, but seems worth the wait. The biscuits and gravy were very good, and the portions large. They have a nice selection of mini pies and the entire menu is available all day long. The waitress was very attentive and efficient, and the food was delish. I'll be back!",1,positive
Waited 50 minutes today for a pulled pork and a hot link sandwich before asking for our money back. I can't imagine how much longer we would of had to wait. I've heard nothing but good things about this place....so disappointed. They weren't even busy!!,0,negative
Wait time wasn't long and food was great!\n\nGive me a double double with animal fries!,1,positive
"It took me more than 20 minutes to get my single to-go order at this location. On a thursday night when there was hardly anyone there this was ridiculous. The food was OK, I've had better Hawaiian BBQ in the valley for less money. At almost ten dollars for the whole meal, it was not worth the money. Fortunately they do have a smaller, less expensive portion that would fill most people up for lunch.",0,negative
"Okay guys 20 mins for a spice ice tea and coffee when we tell you that we are in a hurry.  Tell us you cant do it.  Much better than leaving us hanging until we walk out.  So quick tip yelpers you must have time to visit Red Velvet, between a regular following and a mellow staff time can tick by.",1,positive
"Oh. My. God. If a resto can \""""test\"""" my patience, this is definitely the place. Over an hour after placing my order to get eggs???? Seriously?! Horrendous. I'll never go back.",0,negative
"It took a very long time for the meals to be served. Also, the food is not worth the price IMO.",0,negative
Service is slow the food is ok. I ordered a small fruit bowl and it turned out to be canned fruit. Don't order that. It is just gross!,0,negative
"We had breakfast this morning here. We waited 45 minutes for our breakfasts.   Unfortunately, the servers were less than attentive and we waited almost 30 minutes for a refill of our coffee.  The food was good but the negative experience of the extreme  delay and little concern for us while waiting is all I can remember.  We will not go back.",0,negative
"We waited over 15 minutes to get our food! The place was almost empty. When I went to ask why it was taking so long they said it would be right out. The food then came out cold and not very good. The potato wasn't hot, chopped salad had huge pieces of lettuce. I wouldn't go back.",0,negative
"Horrible!  We waited for over an hour for 3 gluten free fried rice dishes and one other dish.  Finally had to ask to see the manager.  He was stunned we were waiting. Many, many other tables had come and gone.  Our waitress never once came to our table to talk about the wait.  The manager then claimed it was because we had gluten free.  We eat at PF Changs often. This was not a gluten free - takes an hour issue.  It was a bad waitress and cook staff issue!  Will not go back to this location ever!",0,negative
We had to wait 30 min Eventhough we had a reservation. The steak was over cooked and black color. Was very upset about food and services.,0,negative
Food is good. Service sucks. Waited 20 minutes standing in line.,0,negative
"Unbelievably slow! There were 2 people waiting outside & 4 inside all waiting on food. After waiting 5 minutes @ counter I finally got someone to come take my order, 2 slices & a drink, \""""grab & go special\"""". No truth to the name. Waited 15 more minutes for slices. When I left, guy outside was coming in to cancel his order. Lady he was with already had eaten & he still didn't have his sub. Also I ordered to go but they gave it to me on a plate not in a box. Definitely wouldn't go back.",0,negative
I haven't had a problem with this place so far so I don't understand the bad reviews. I do usually order take out and it takes between 15 min to 45 min which isn't bad. I love their spicy garlic entree and bubble tea. Will continue to order take out from here.,1,positive
"On a recent visit to Charlotte, a friend and her husband picked  me up at CLT to take me to my hotel, and we decided to get a bite to eat before they dropped me off.  They told me about Cowfish and how good their sushi was as well as their burgers and milkshakes.\n\nGranted it was a Friday evening, and it did not seem to be overly crowded, so I was not expecitng a 90 minute wait.  But it gave my friends and I a chance to sit and catch up as we waited.",1,positive
"we dined there on a recent friday night.  Our relatively simple order took about an hour.  There was never an explanation provided as to why the meals were taking so long.  ALSO, just outside the main door and among all of the outdoor dining tables were about 15 cigarette butts.  Not too appetizing.  clean it up!  and don't let your staff smoke in front of the door.   We enjoy the food, but it can't take an hour to prepare a salad and pork schnitzel.",0,negative
"I was rushed the moment I got in the door. I ordered a BBQ Beef Brisket sandwich, which was good, but the fries which were skinny and crispy had potential, but were cold and overcooked. The waitress definitely wanted to be somewhere else, was not inviting environment, so will definitely shoot for another place next time in Pittsburgh, although the city as a whole is awesome!",0,negative
Waited two hours for a big party. Waited another 30 minutes for the food.  The food was okay but definitely not worth the wait.  La Parilla  Suiza is much better!,0,negative
17 minutes for a cold sandwich.  People who ordered after me got theirs first and no apology for it taking so long just left a bad taste in my mouth. The employee looked at me like it had not been almost 20 minutes for a to go sandwich,0,negative
There's always a wait on weekends but you expect that at such a simple but great place. The bruschetta boards are amazing!!!! Salads are also really good.,1,positive
"Wait time was terrible! When we did get our food the eggs were cold.  Waitress was nice, I know not her fault for the cooking time.",0,negative
Took close to 20 minutes for an incredibly bland burger and mediocre fries. They couldn't even give me a full cup of ketchup. Absolutely not worth the money. How could anyone eat here on their lunch break? Save your time and money and hit Cookout.,0,negative
We had to wait over 30 minutes to be served a couple of burgers. No wait at the door. Then when we received order things were not cooked as requested. \nHad to send back . So all told from time we sat down it rock about 50 minutes to get our order complete. Lots of choices in the area !! I think I'd look to one of them next time.,0,negative
"Service was slow.  7 rolls came out one at a time over the course of 45 minutes so that no one really ate together.  At the end, a gratuity was automatically added.  We had a party of 5.  Never heard of an automatic gratuity for a party of 5, but then again, I have never had worse service.",0,negative

"Just so you know...you will wait.  I waited 45 minutes for food for five people. Just so you REALLY UNDERSTAND.....IT IS WORTH IT.  I tasted the ginger, scallions, the garlic.  no excess oil in the noodles or fried rice.  The food is prepared FRESH, FRESH, FRESH! Everything is prepared so beautifully, so carefully....people, GO!!!!!!!  You will not be disappointed.  I live over fifty miles away and I will and I mean this, I WILL BE BACK!",1,positive
"Sooooo slow.  Over 30 min for soup.  Then one dish was completely wrong.  Very disappointed to see that all of the pork items we came for (roast, belly, cracklins and \""""love\"""") were out.  This will prevent me from driving over just for Ramen again.  Aweful",0,negative
"We were a party of six and ordered 9 items altogether And the food was good. But it took 2 hours from being seated to getting the bill. One hour before our main dishes appeared. We had to remind the waiter twice about the desserts.\nWe were seated upstairs, which perhaps slows things down. But this place is not cheap and two hours for a Chinese dinner is absurd.",0,negative
We were the only ones in the restaurant on a Sunday night yet each roll we ordered took 20-30 minutes to complete. We were also served water straight from the tap and had a very difficult getting ahold of a waiter/waitress. The food was good but I was not impressed with the overall experience.,0,negative
"This isn't a review of the food, just the way the business is run. I was anxious to taste their chicken schawarma and arrived about 10:55 a.m. I went to the door and saw that they opened at 11 a.m., so I went back to wait in my car and play some candy crush on my phone. I waited until 11:15, but they never opened. Maybe I'll give them another chance since they have such good reviews, but if they're reading this, \""""Please open on time!\""""",0,negative
"Arrived and was told it was a hour wait. Fine. After 1 hour and 45 I started inquiring more on how much longer it would take. Was told \""""cleaning table now\"""".

"Not impressed at all. Took 1 hr and 45 minutes for 4 of us. That's extremely slow for even the best steakhouses in town let alone an Asian place. We ordered around 6 items, I ate only one bite from 4 of the dishes. The fried dumplings and pork buns were the best items we had. The sauce that came with the calamari was absolutely horrid. Food was just not good enough for the wait - won't ever be back.",0,negative
We are here to have a bite to eat the lane to sit down is about fifteen minutes.  The coffee was good and our waitress was very nice and the chicken and waffles a must-have,1,positive
We didnt have to wait very long which was nice. I ordered a tiramisu cake and a chocolate mousse cake with strawberry. The tiramisu cake was DELICIOUS! I would order that again. The chocolate mousse cake was ok. I wouldnt get that again. It was a little pricey but I expected that. I love the large window as youre waiting. Someone was decorating a cake inside and its just fun to watch.,1,positive
Stopped in for a quick drink on new years eve about 3 pm . The place was empty . The bartender Chris was rude and very vulger . He made a crude sexual comment as soon as we sat down . We decided to stay for a drink anyway . After going a couple of choices we were told the bar was out of most stock . On New Years Eve ??? The Bartender kept complaining about his job and bosses for the next 10 minutes . We paid for our drinks and got up and left . Might be the strangest employee experience I had in awhile .,0,negative
"Their waiters need to learn basic math. I ordered an alcoholic drink (I AM over 21, but I look younger) and the waiter took my ID and studied it for a good minute, then gave it back, said OK and went off to get our drinks.

"Seriously? I don't get why the clubs out here act the way they do.

Was enjoying dinner and a beer @the bar when a guy walks in with a 2yr kid in his arms & sits @bar next to me! Then guy puts kid up on the bar! Kid is caring on and yelling sitting on top of the bar!

Stopped into the bar for happy hour while waiting to meet a friend. Not very busy but bartender failed to greet me for at least 5 minutes.

Stopped in for a post Pirate game beer last night. I ordered an IPA and sat down at the bar. I couldn't wait to leave as the sour smell of stale beer and who knows  what wafted from the tap drains.

A few days ago went to Bonanno's with friends. Although the food was good the atmosphere was not. Unfortunately the entire restaurant overheard a bartender yelling at a server.

I normally love this bar but the bartender tonight was Anthony and he is awful. I went to the bar to get a drink and he was off to the side flirting with someone.  As a customer I shouldn't be ignored while you try to get laid.,0,negative
Why would anyone pay money for food like this?,0,negative
Place works very slow the severs keep playing around and when I got my spinach artichoke dip there was noodles on the inside of it.,0,negative
We ventured to Feedbag tonight and were not impressed with the food. The service was very good and portion sizes were nice but the instant macaroni and cheese and instant mashed potatoes left us disappointed.,0,negative
Didn't understand I wanted the lunch special and not the lunch plate. Mostly vegetables in the Kungpow chicken. Place is run down. Large portions.,0,negative
This place told us they have a  very limited on the menu tonight.\nI tried to space the second time it may have been third time but the menu seems to be always limited so be cautious their pies are good but I don't understand how restaurant can be open with a limited menu all the time items are not available on the menu maybe that's why the one on the westside side has closed.,0,negative
Food tasted like it came out of cardboard boxes or something i could have gotten at costco is was nasty and service was bad.,0,negative
Wild menu..huge portions .. Just ok.,0,negative
I don't get it. I ordered the chicken and waffles like everyone recommended but it was very tasteless and over cooked. Maybe I'll try it again. Just don't see it though. It was large enough for 2 people however. Maybe 3 since non of us cared for it.,0,negative
"overpriced, small portions. There's far better food for the same price range.",0,negative
I really wanted to like this place but the portion sizes was tiny. I had there bento box with Chicken Teriyaki but there was more vegetables then chicken. It should have been called  Vegetables Teriyaki. Too much money for too little food. After dinner I went out to get another meal to satisfy my less than full stomach!,0,negative
Made myself and husband very sick. Poor service. Poor quality food. Our child's food was not edible. Disappointed and probably will not return.,0,negative
"Overpriced, tiny portions. sigh. My friends said that they loved the HH specials... so maybe I'd suggest giving that a try. The service was pretty awesome, but sadly, the food couldn't deliver. Just expect to spend a lot of money for sub-par food.",0,negative
"Snooty and expensive. Tiny portions of \""""precious\"""" food. Get real, please.",0,negative
This food sucks. I would rather spend 20 cents on ramen noodles because I would end up happier. Even when a coworker drags you here just pass on putting any of this in your mouth. No matter how hungry you are!,0,negative
Diner food done at a typical diner level.,0,negative
"The only good item in the limited menu is the short ribs. Everything else is bad to worse. Too pricy for the quality and choices, felt like a rip off.",0,negative
"The food was simply not tasty, pita bread undercooked, same with the falafel, and when trying to address it there was no one there to get it :( Too bad, great potential. I don't see why if you are already in the kitchen cooking you wouldn't invest a little in trying to make it good, nonetheless eatable. This was a bad (and not cheap) experience.",0,negative
"Tony B review on 11/27/10 states he had a hair on his fruit.  The EXACT same thing happened to me.  \n\nYou don't get very much food for the price, but what you get tastes good.  If it was a little cheaper and I had not gotten hairy fruit I might have gone 3 stars on this.  I will go back but this is not one of those places that I would rave about.",0,negative
I was so excited when greens and proteins opened. I would stop everyday on my way to work (4-5 days a week)  and ordered a wellness drink ( which I love) and a turkey wrap. It was over priced but worth it. About 3 months later they changed the turkey patty to a processed frozen patty with no taste. Every time I try something new it has no taste. They are starting to cut corners to save money. I am very disappointed in the quality of the food.,0,negative
"It is out of expectation for all dishes with high price..and long line \nYes, it has more international foods selection \nBut it cost about $52.00 per\nI spent 2 hours and can not tasted all....\nThe quality is poor .. It is not yummy at all..\nThe brisket and sausages are overcooked..\n\nEven you can sitting in but has been with another long line for seafoods and prime rib line...\nIt is not worth it for that $ and spent time\n the long line ..\nIt was so disappointed !!!",0,negative
Warning! Had the foie grass dish. Worst ever. Do not order this. Asked to have it redone and they brought the same platter. Do not order. This is junk.,0,negative
food is nothing exceptional but charges premium price.  BBQ ribs too salty and over  cooked.  chicken is dry.  hate to compare this to KFC.,0,negative
Def a case of style over substance. Tofu is flavorless and everything else over spiced. Super small portions for the price. Kids' Mac and cheese served cold. Bleh.,0,negative
"I enjoyed going to this place with my daughter. Good atmosphere and the staff was friendly. Pick a piece off the shelf, sit down, listen to some good pointers and then paint away. Set aside a couple of hours if you are doing something detailed as you want to get three good coats of color.",1,positive
Would give 0 stars if I could! I used to tan at the location at greenfield and brown. The owner closed the doors without notice!!!!! I had units and $115 lotion that I will never see again.  Trying to get help has been like pulling teeth. \nThis was a response I received!  DO NOT TAN HERE!!!!!!!!!,0,negative
Terry is by far THE best in the biz! Get a airbrush bundle of tans... Because you WILL return and use them!,1,positive
"This place is such a nice change of pace from the crappy, corporate tanning places that are pretty much the monopoly in town.  They actually offer shorter packages and don't require your first born and all your banking info just to flipping tan!\n\nThe owner and employees are really chill, not high pressure sales people trying to shove $80 bottles of lotion down your throat.  They also have a cool assortment of unique purses and clothing.\n\nVery cool to see a biz woman making it instead of a corporation:)",1,positive
"Have had several Tattoos done at Staytrue by Jason Murphy. He is friendly and professional. I couldn't be happier with his work. I have a ton of tattoos all over my body some more than 30 years old and from great artists around the country and I always recommend Jason locally. There is a reason he sometimes has a waiting list, just like a good restaurant requires reservations. Just check out his website to see his work.",1,positive
"Avoid Adore skin care products AT  ALL COSTS. The products are highly allergenic, the sales techniques are very high pressure, and we were not told that the products were non refundable before purchase.  This appears to be a SCAM. We were deliberately not given receipts that stated the refund policy. The only receipt we were given DID NOT state this policy. AVOI D ADORE.",0,negative
Robert is by far the best. He's got such a lighthand. My portrait tattoo healed beautifully. Worth every penny all day long.,1,positive
"I have been looking for a new shop since i came to Phoenix about 2 years ago. I was on my way to a different tattoo shop and decided to stop at Inkenstein just to check it out on the way. I showed up at the right time as Jason was finishing with a customer so i had no wait time. I threw out my ideas, he gave his, tweaked them a little bit and i ended up with a perfect tattoo. Exactly what i pictured. My wife will be coming here soon for her next tattoo and i will be back for sure.",1,positive
"I wanted a tattoo of my dog Zoey. I did my research on local artists and decided on Eddie. My research time really paid off because the work Eddie did is nothing short of awesome! The detail is incredible, right down to her whiskers.The coloring is spot on. He even captured her intangible qualities: personality, heart and soul. To say I'm pleased is a complete understatement. The whole experience was great.\nI would not hesitate to get another tattoo from Eddie or to highly recommend him. \nThank you Eddie, Jane",1,positive
"Worste customer service ever. Went in & asked the girl behind the counter about prices, when she was done texting she quickly went over them & was rude about it. I'll never return.\n\nLuckily I found Elite Tanning off Silverado Ranch & Bermuda. Girls are always friendly & the salon is always clean. Love all the beds they offer & great on prices :)",0,negative
"Trust me when I say that I am a tanning connoisseur and this place is the best place I've ever been! Its the cleanest, fastest and safest way to tan. Unlike some places in town they have a very friendly knowledgeable staff. Don't just take my word for it try them out yourself they give you your first tan absolutely FREE and its their most powerful booth..just make sure to bring in your local ID. ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PLACE!",1,positive
Received my first tattoo here and it was great experience.  I showed Anthony a general idea and he took it from there.  He came up with a very nice piece and we knocked it out.  Definitely recommend.,1,positive
"So, I had never gotten a spray tan before this experience.  It was surprisingly positive.  I thought I'd come out of there looking like that old chick in Something About Mary...but it looked FABULOUS!  It looked completely natural.  The whole process was quick, professional and comfortable.  I loved it and will be back.",1,positive
The best in body art/paint in town.... For the totally unique 'Vegas' experience...check out Skin City ...,1,positive
My daughter went and loved it. Got a spray on tan. In and out. No fuss no muss. And no appointment.  good crew.,1,positive
I just started tanning here... so far I think they are great - They seem to have nice clean beds and all the employees are so friendly,1,positive
"Called Jonathan and started talking over the phone and email about what I was looking for. He worked me into his very busy schedule. He was direct and forthcoming with feedback and artistic direction. When we met face to face, he got me in early and took good care of me. I love my ink and can't wait to show it off. I'd definitely recommend Private Tattoo.",1,positive
"Great, clean professional shop. Alex did my tattoo. He is nice, personable and professional. Very happy with my tattoo. Looking at his work his black and gray tattoos are amazing and portrait work is great. Recommended if in Vegas!",1,positive
"This is by far the best airbrush tan I have ever had. I love all of their solutions and love having the option to have the quick 1-4 hour tan.  Their spray is always even and I walk out of there looking dark just how I like! Donna is a master and like I said, I have never had a better spray tan. Also their monthly package is amazing and cannot be beat. I am hooked and will keep coming back forever!!!",1,positive
"This place is great! I was visiting from out of town and looking for a place that could airbrush me. They were very flexible with their schedule and fit my friend and I in with no problem. The staff was very friendly, the have great prices, good location, clean place, great hours, & easy to schedule future appointments with this online program. I was very happy with my results! \n I am moving down to Arizona in a couple months and i will go back to their location when im back!",1,positive
"The guys at Empire are really awesome people. They were so friendly and really fun to be around in general. Paul, the guy who did my piercings, knew bis stuff. He told me exactly what I needed to know and made the whole process really comfortable. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who asks! They have great prices as well which is always a plus! I will absolutely be going back.",1,positive
"The man who was taking in my dry cleaning order was very short with me, rude, and then threw (literally) my clothes into a basket as I walked away. I asked if he could be more gentle with my clothes and he told me \""""They're fine\"""". I promptly asked for my clothes back and took them to Denny's on Mattis. Last time I use any Starcrest dry cleaning.",0,negative
"They really do a great job, and you will really pay for it. I don't have incredibly pricey clothing, so getting my $50 blouses dry cleaned here just doesn't make sense- but I would absolutely trust them with very important articles (nice sport coats, lined trousers, wedding gowns, blood soaked mattresses... haha, kidding).",1,positive
"Great service!! They are the nicest people and run a wonderful business. This is by far the best dry cleaner I've found in the area. They really take care of my clothes and get out stains with ease. The turn around time is really quick too, and I have tendency to bring in a lot of clothes at once. Haven't gone anywhere else since I found Park Avenue Cleaners  almost 6 years ago.  Can't recommend them enough!",1,positive
"I was using this cleaner for a few months, but not really sure why. The staff is rude and even worse, they jacked up my clothes. I asked for some repairs on two pairs of suit pants. Instead of fixing them, they sliced the butt of one of the pants and did not repair the other, while still charging me. Stupid me for not checking them before paying and going home. I don't trust them to fix it so I took them elsewhere. WILL NOT BE GOING BACK.",0,negative
Horrible customer service.  I just watched the man in front of me get treated like crap over a $1 additional charge.  The cashier was dismissive and flat out rude.  I won't be coming back here and neither will that man.  She just lost this business 2 customers over $1 and her bad attitude.   The quality of the wash was decent hence the 2 stars.,0,negative
"I hadn't brought anything to Apollo Cleaners for a long time, and now I remember why.   I brought in a wool blanket and the person I gave it to, wasn't sure they could clean it.  She told me they would call and let me know.   Weeks went by, they never called so I stopped by.  They gave it back to me on a hanger and wanted $18.    They may have pressed it, but it was hardly cleaned and THEY NEVER CALLED.\n\nIf you need cleaning, find another cleaner.   Poor customer service, questionable processes.",0,negative
"DH dropped off some pants for dry cleaning.  When we got them back one pant wasn't even cleaned.  For the price this isn't something you can overlook.  When we brought it to their attention they fixed it promptly, but were unapologetic about it.  Plus we had to wait another 4-5 days.  I won't be back",0,negative
"This has been my favorite Dry Cleaners for many years now. I wish i had coupons  to use here but, i never get them in the mail. However, i love this place, they do a fantastic job. Everything is always clean and fresh and pressed just the way you want it.  Good location, always very busy. The staff that works there are always very friendly. Plus it is very inexpensive/    So what more could you want.",1,positive
They always take about 2 days and have ruined 3 of my husband's very expensive dress shirts and of course refused to take responsibility for it. Luckily Macy's was kind enough to replace even though it wasn't their fault at all. They had a different excuse each time for why it wasn't their fault,0,negative
"Had a shirt taken to them to be serviced three times, and still they did not dry-clean it. I would hav been better off doing it myself in my sink at home.",0,negative
This place screwed my friend Marlena. She paid $59.99 for a service call and they said they would be back the next day and they weren't. She continues to try and call them to no avail. Now she is sitting with no dryer and out of $60!,0,negative
Stayed at Mandalay Bay this past weekend and left a $300 pair of Jeans in my room. Housekeeping decided to keep them as we called back the following day and no jeans were ever turned in! As frequent stayers @ Mandalay it's very disappointing that the maid service is keeping clothes rather then turning them back in so that their customers can get them back! Thank you NOT so much Mandalay!,0,negative
I gather from Jaime who works here that they are hurting and they brought him in to stop giving things away.  Now they charge $2 for a squirt of air freshener.  Wow... won't be back again.  This place is now double the cost of the car wash just north on 83rd in front of Walmart.  The quality and customer care has gone there instead of here.,0,negative
Lint left on suit snags in suit coat. Worse job ever. Never again. There has to be better places that won't leave stuff dirty and ruined. Stay away and find another place if you like your clothes!,0,negative

"Fresh Cleaners was OK, but the customer service was really lacking. \n\nThe young woman at the desk seemed a little unsure and didn't really seem to understand (or maybe didn't know how to explain) their cleaning process when it comes to delicate items. \n\nI felt good about going here because of the \""""green\"""" cleaning method, but the customer service was a let down. Plus, when I got one of my tops home, a thread had come loose on the cuff. And the fibers seemed very worn, like it had been brushed.",0,negative
"Starting off by saying this place is expensive.  Yeah, having a bathroom with a hand dryer is a perk, I'll admit that, but paying for a wash that doesn't really rinse your laundry (very visible soap suds during rinse cycle) and dryers that are unable to dry a t shirt in 16 minutes when set on high heat is ridiculous.  Four dollars ($4.00+) to dry a coverlet?!  \nPlace is clean, but it is expensive and inefficient.",0,negative
Rude employees who aren't very intelligent or have much of a personality. I had a shirt done here and they put holes in it. I would not recommend this cleaners.,0,negative
I tried out this place because I didn't care for the last place I had my suits dry cleaned.  The service is great and the pricing is spot on.  I had to take a week long business trip and these guys were able to fold all my shirts with plastic wrapped around.  This worked amazing for packing reasons.  Great cleaners!,1,positive
"Affordable and fast!  $1.75 for laundered shirts, $4.50 for dress dry cleaning, $8 original hems.",1,positive
EZ and fast but broken button on basic wash so forced  to upgrade and wash cash only no ATM,0,negative
"OneClick Cleaners is the most convenient cleaning services I have used! I had a ton of business shirts just sitting in my laundry bin.

I can be at work while my laundry is being done and when I get home it's ready for me! My shirts are brought back to life after their cleaning services.

My first time here! Loved it. Will definitely come back :) Also loved that they had a deal on groupon,1,positive
Just came back from here.  So incredible. The new haunt is great. I won't give any spoilers.  I do love that they pump smells in certain rooms.  All the themig is great. I do wish they did some more with the Christmas one. It's lacking a bit. Otherwise incredible.,1,positive

This was my second haircut here and my last. If you're male, do your hair and pocketbook a favor: don't go to Haircutters in the Park.\n\nBy the way, they don't like to put tips on credit cards. That's a telling sign that this place is not as high-class as they claim to be.",0,negative
"My barber is Marco, Always punctual! I love it, been going to him every week for 4 years now and i dont plan on changing. When I set appts hes always ready on time and makes me feel like a VIP. Ive went to other barbers if he was off or the 1 time he was out sick and they all do great",1,positive

"A quick trim and she did an okay job, but I had the impression that my stylist would have preferred to be taking a break instead of cutting my hair. I'll get another stylist next time.\n\nThey have an app so that you can check in when you're on the way, so you don't have to wait.",0,negative

"I have never loved a haircut so much till I got here. I read reviews here on Yelp and they didn't disappoint at all. I called to schedule for Kim and she is the nicest hairdresser I've had in a while. It's so hard to find a good hair salon but thank goodness for Isis. Shampoo, haircut (layers & side bangs), blow dry, straightened and styled with my thick, frizzy, long, unhealthy hair for $30? I'll be coming here from now on. Thank you Kim!",1,positive
"Ruined my weekend in Vegas!!! messed up my cut. so simple how hard is a taper fade with a 4 on top. Old man gave me a 1 all around with a 4. So pissed. 17 bucks is a damn rip off... Nice people, but don't deserve there barbers license",0,negative

"I paid $16 for a haircut.  I got a $16 haircut.  No appointments, walk-in and put your name on a list.  They have not mastered the art of the scissors cut for men.

"Not having had a real haircut in years I was incredibly apprehensive about going, but Karen did a fantabulous job. I look 15 years younger and feel like I need to buy new clothes to match my wonderful hair!! The only minor complaint I have is the window says walk-ins are welcome, but no one was available until an hour later. If I didn't live so close, that may have prevented me from returning. What a travesty that would have been!!",1,positive
"After being a client at a studio (c) in sundial plaza and paying a ridiculous amount ($500) for the standard cut and color I decided to try salon chella. So happy that I did. Not only was the price 1/4 of the cost at the other salon, the result was 10 times better!  Go see Kim.",1,positive

I love love love this company! We are MN residents and come to AZ to escape the winters. The day we get here I am on the phone with AZ Pet Stylists to get on their schedule for our schnauzer mix that arrives with a full MN winter coat.

"What a great find thanks to previous Yelpers. This is the best haircut I have had in a very long time.  Hot towel and neck/shoulder massage after my cut.  Wow you can't beat that. Well worth the couple of extra $. Wish I had a V\""""s back home",1,positive
"I got a great cut from Matt and, seriously, the best shampoo job I've ever had. That guy gave me an awesome head massage for like 10 minutes. Amazing. \nThe salon is super hip and they are setting up a little resale shop for designer clothes in the back.\n$50 for just a cut this time, but I'll be back for color.",1,positive
"In town with buddies for March madness and decided to splurge on a good haircut. Ended up getting the cut, royal shave, and a goatee trim while there.  Awesome experience and very relaxing for around $100.  Master barber Ron DiMascio who is very experienced did a great job!",1,positive

This is the best place to get your haircut and I always enjoy getting my haircut. Thanks for all your great service.,1,positive
"Very unimpressed with this salon. I got a basic trim and it cost $75. I felt like this was a bit over priced for what I got, but nonetheless I went back a second time and the price was increased to $100. So beware prices apparently they just go up whenever they feel like it. Additionally, making an appointment was a pain as no call was ever returned after leaving a message at the salon. Overall, just not worth the price and hassle.",0,negative

Unbelievable experience!  Just moved here from Chicago and my mom is a hair stylist.  I've always been very wary of getting my hair cut as I never had to pay for it.

"I just got a haircut here today. The salon is clean and has a nice atmosphere. I asked for it to be short, clean, and professional, and I could not ask for a better haircut. She does a very meticulous job to ensure everything is even with no stray hairs sticking out. I usually have problems with short haircut at other places because I have that little bump in my occipital region and she made sure to cut it so it hides it well so my hair is evenly blended. Can't ask for a better hair stylist.",1,positive
"Amazing hair cut, great guy, way better service then I've ever gotten at any chain barber. Will definitely be going back!",1,positive
I've gone to the Mane twice and have been happy with both haircuts. I've had two different people cut my hair and it seems like everyone there has lots of experience. The only thing I wasn't totally satisfied with was the straight razor shave. It wasn't terrible but I've had better.,1,positive
Great classic cut from a very knowledgeable barber. Can't beat the price or location and laidback Westcoast vibe as well.,1,positive

"I have been getting Rony's scissor cut for the past seven years. I have difficult, thick, kinky/curly hair and he knows how to make sure it looks good- immediately after the cut, and when it fills in too. In addition to a great cut, it is a pleasant break to talk and joke with Rony while in his chair. Finally, he has his own place! His prices are more competitive than in his past shops and and he still gives the best scissor cut in the valley. Shoulder massage and hot/cold towel, and rinse too, if you want.",1,positive
"kiko is an amazing artist. My hair was long and in need of an \""""attitude adjustment\"""". I gave a vague direction for my new style and Kiko brought it full circle. When I looked in the mirror for the first time after Kiko completed the cut, I was amazed! He created a master piece!! Thank you Kiko for being such a talented hair designer! I love my new do!",1,positive
"Best haircut I have ever received, Pittsburgh or otherwise.  Ryan obviously has a love for what he does and an eye for style.   All this and the price is right.  Walk-ins only,so you might have to wait for someone to finish, but that was not my experience.",1,positive
"Usually good but today was terrible. Ordered eggs basted soft. Got scrambled. Sent back and they came back cold, basted with oil and burnt around the edges. Toast was pretty much NOT toasted. Manager brought out more eggs as we were paying the bill. They adjusted the check though, so that was nice.",0,negative
"Horrible food. My bun was hard and the onion rings tasted like old grease. They forgot my husband's french fries and of course, we didn't realize it until we were down the road. Will not return.",0,negative
Worst experience my boyfriend and I have ever had going out to eat. Food was cold and looked and tasted like it was all microwaved. Table and booth was dirty and sticky. If you want a quick but good breakfast definitely go to U.S Egg,0,negative
"The only good thing here is the hot soy milk. But the soy milk was room temp today. Service wasn't so great. Waitress sorta kept ignoring us. The plates and utensils were dirty. Again, try to come here for breakfast only for the soy milk.",0,negative
"Hit n Miss,,, and this one should have Missed.... \n\nCountry Ham, definitely left tout too long, and was not very good,, only had 2 bites out of it and determined NO WAY.. Waitress never questioned why I didnt finish it, oh well.. Not saying done on purpose, but none the less, will never be back at this location. \n\nFor a Waffle house, they may not be the cleanliest, but they are usually great food at a fraction of the costs.. love these places on road trips !!",0,negative
"I ordered a BLT on rye.  When it arrived it even looked unappetizing.  I sent it back and the replacement was not much better.  This time the bacon was only overlooked and dry, instead of actually burned.  The bread wasn't replaced, and was dried out.  The 2 slim slices of tomato were, well,ugly.\n\nI understand their ad for new cooks and wish them well.  The services was also ho-hum.",0,negative
"Read all the reviews before going so I was a little skeptical but thought I would try anyway. Cute little place, seated right away which was good for a Saturday at 1230. Ordered eggs Benedict but they had sold out! A breakfast place that runs out of breakfast food, hum. Got the breakfast sandwich which came out cut in half, on a large white plate with no garnish. Had to ask for silverware and napkins. Service was ok, sandwich average.",0,negative
"Panchos- 2 eggs 2 pancakes & your choice of meat. I had bacon. \n\nFor my bacon, all I tasted was Salt! Eggs were good. Pancakes were tasteless. Service was ok. But I would NOT come here again.",0,negative
I order breakfast and it was not very impressive at all.   You know it's bad when the eggs have no taste and served cold.  Not to mention there were flies everywhere.  I will not eat here again and I don't recommend it.,0,negative
"I dislike Mimi's Cafe.  I always have.  I decided that, after a few years of avoidance that they would improve.  I was dead wrong.  Mimi's is still meh.  I had breakfast there with my mother while my father was in surgery down the street.  I ordered croissants, which were delicious, but the actual meal of potatoes, bacon, and eggs was horrid.  It was chewy bacon with bland eggs and oily potatoes. \n\nEw.\n\nSorry, but I dislike Mimi's for many reasons, all of which relate to their food and sad service.",0,negative
we wanted have breakfast before we left vegas so we came here. to be honest I wasn't really expecting much and this place exceeded my expectations. I had the smoked salmon eggs benedict with hash browns and nutella waffle w/cream. everything was excellent,1,positive
broccoli and egg omelet was delicious! i think it cost 12.00 so it was reasonable. the waiter brought out delicious glasses of tap water to go with it!\n\nhash browns were acceptable./ nothing to brag about. wheat toast was standard\n\nthis place exceeded my expectations for 3:00 a.m. on a saturday morning in vegas. no wait to be seated and plenty of tables. lots of staff working too\n\ni would go back.,1,positive
Pretty gross breakfast. The only reason they are getting any stars is because the waitress was nice enough to take some of the food off the bill when she asked how I liked it and I answered honestly,0,negative
"Great poached eggs and corned beef hash but wow, salty. Good coffee and great pecan sticky bun - really small so don't skip the \""""pastry course\"""". Really slow service; we arrived at 9:30am on a Monday and there were about 4 tables of people. However the hostess & waitress for our group of 8 was very nice.",1,positive
My boyfriend and I just had brunch yesterday morning. He insisted on going here because he said the food was excellent when he went years ago. We waited in a long line (35 minutes). We were totally disappointed with the quality of the food. Everything that should've been hot was mildy warm/cold. A complete waste of money. I'm giving it 1 star because the service was good.,0,negative
Mediocre service and sub-par food quality.  I'd rather make my own breakfast than go here.  If you're committed to having someone else scramble your eggs go to a nicer place that focuses more on quality rather than quantity...seriously this place is huge and you won't really enjoy yourself.  I know I didn't.\n\nThere are plenty of other places to go in the immediate area...I just really don't think this place is getting into a car and driving for.,0,negative
I think my expectations for this restaurant were a little to high.... for someone who was completely sober and hungry at 6:00a. I ordered 1 multi- grain pancake with fruit. I literally waited 25 minutes for 1 pancake. It was 100% tasteless. I even douzed it in syrup and butter to taste a little flavor... still nothing. Service friendly but definetly not efficient.,0,negative
"I don't understand how the place got such high reviews.  The recovery on their customer service was non-existent after I had to send my coffee back 3 times because the creamer was curled.  The food was below average, and orange juice  smelled funny.  If I could score zero stars on Yelp I would.  Save yourself the disappointment and eat at home.",0,negative
"Food was pretty good. Coffee was awful. Service was pitiful. We waited 15 minutes for our coffee before breakfast. Waitress disappeared for that whole time. The food came and -- oops-- she forgot about the coffee, water and OJ. Breakfast over, and she was nowhere to be found again. Will not go back.",0,negative
"What a horrible experience! ... Don't waste your time!!!!!!!! Not only did it take an hour to get our food, when they brought out their \""""famous\"""" pancakes, it was cooked with pieces of broccoli! Also, my bacon was burnt! When I let our waitress know she went to speak to manager who never came to apologize, and instead of taking my meal off they only took off a few bucks!  What a terrible place! Don't bother unless you want broccoli pancakes and hard burnt bacon! Oh and a ridiculously long wait!",0,negative
Just average to below average. Space is too small. Undersized plates. Cheap silverware. Servers are nice. People overall friendly.  Undercooked bacon.  Undercooked french toast.  Hard to screw up breakfast.  When we go out to eat breakfast you just have to get it right.  Breakfast food is not hard to cook.  You have to get it right every time.,0,negative
"Below average food experience for me and good for my GF. I took my breakfast sandwich back after it was more lettuce than substance and was just not good at all and it was replaced with a weak, unflavorful helping of the omlette special. Very underwhelming food. Young wait staff was unorganized and slow. But were very friendly. Check it off the list. Over rated in my opinion. Marigold, Bluefies, Hubbard Ave are WAY better in all areas. Especially, in the overall food quality, consistency catagory.",0,negative
Fabulous eggs benedict and waffles. The french toast was kind of mediocre but we came here two days in a row because of the friendly service and willing to adjust items due to food allergies. Both days I got the chicken eggs benedict the first day were the potatoes and the next day I paid a little extra for the garden salad which was pretty average. Husband got waffles first day which were excellent but the French Toast he got the second day was quite average. Tons of seating including outdoor I would love to come back,1,positive
Wow if I could give this place a big fat 0 I would. HORRIBLE. They were out of some of the bread for their sandwiches. Imagine a bakery that is out of bread. We also ordered their featured seasonal soup. Guess what? They were out of it.  Food not worth the price. Don't go.,0,negative
"Had breakfast here while staying at the hotel for work.  Server was okay, but the atmosphere is very \""""hotel restaurant\"""" and my eggs Benedict were drowning in hollandaise sauce yet still quite tasteless.  I didn't return during my stay, and won't in the future - there are too many legitimately good places nearby.  Also, expensive.",0,negative
"Their food always tastes homemade and the omelets are fantastic.  I would definitely recommend the biscuits and gravy as well.\n\nI've read some comments on here about the service, but we have been there over a dozen times and never have had a bad experience. It does get really busy on the weekends but as long as you're patient and you don't go into there expecting McDonald's like speed, you shouldn't be let down.",1,positive
"When with such importunity the reference of fresh fruits(in the breakfast menu), do bring forth only of well described produce. The cut honeydew and cantaloup melons we're clearly overrippen per the squishy texture and the translucide blemishes around the edges. My wife had the smoked meat plate. The sandwich is flavorful but irrelevant when the cole slaw tasted expired.  \nAlas, the waitress was quite pleasant and attended well her patrons.",0,negative
"Stopped in for breakfast this morning & didn't care much for the place.  It started with a 10 minute wait in line to pay.  Then it was another 15+ minutes before the food came out.\n\nI ordered a \""""Ginormous\"""" Breakfast, which it wasn't.  This consisted of 3 eggs, 3 smallish pancakes, 3 small pieces of very salty ham, & some rather dry potato wedges, for $10.\n\nTo me, it wasn't as good as the same priced breakfasts at some of our other choices around town such as Matt's, & I doubt that I will return here again.",0,negative
"Just mediocre. My husband ordered the sunrise sandwich and he couldn't finish it since it was SO salty. The issue for me is that I ordered the \""""mixed berry\"""" yogurt parfait with granola. What a joke. No berries at all, just some fruit drizzle in the yogurt..barely any granola. Also ordered the turkey sausage too--very salty and it was spicy which the menu should have stated it was spicy. Not that good. We won't be back as there are too many other choices for breakfast and that are fresher and better prepared.",0,negative
"We just stopped in on a cold, but sunny morning, on our bicycles to warm up with a latte and muffin. Hadn't read the previous reviews, but our experience was good. The lattes were good and served promptly, and the pumpkin muffin was excellent. I will go back again.",1,positive
"Always wanted to try. Not impressed. Their signature drink frozen hot drinks were somewhat a little disappointing. Too sweet, tasted like a slushy melted ice cream. We had the chicken and waffles for breakfast... Ummmm no!!! Chicken too dry, potato too dry and waffles just lack that umpf! Pricing was a little over priced for the food that you ca",0,negative
"Food can be found at any Denny's or cafe. Ordered me some steak and eggs after a long night and since we miss the \""""normal\"""" breakfast hours, I figured I should get at least some meat in me since it was already noon. Service was average, but attempted to be good. Decor was very beautiful with glass all the way to the ceiling, but it doesn't make up for the food. Costs me $45 total for 2 steak and eggs which also included tips and tax. Not worth it especially since the steak had no flavor whatsoever.",0,negative
"This is an update to the reviews that I have posted....\n\nI'm disappointed by some of the feedback posted about The Liberty. Either my standards are low or I have consistently been lucky. Most recently, I went for Sunday brunch and had an excellent \""""full English\"""" breakfast. My friend had the crab-cake eggs Benedict and was equally impressed.\n\nI have moved homes and sadly can't get to The Liberty more often.",1,positive
Food was good and cooked how we wanted. The place was clean and our server was great. You can't ask for more than that in a Denny's. nice alternative to spending money since it is right next door. I'm not a fan of chain breakfast establishments but this place serves the purpose. Conveniently next door and open 24 hours.,1,positive
"Went there for breakfast. Coffee was served luke warm. My wife's pancakes tasted sour. Server didn't really seem to care when we complained. My chicken fried steak was pretty good, but nothing special. We generally like Timbers for drinks and dinner items, but they failed on this morning. Probably won't be going back to this one, especially for breakfast.",0,negative
"I think they must write their own reviews. Just a very average place. I just had lunch, wafer thin chicken breast, so over cooked I could barely cut it, with frozen seasoned fake fries. \nI have had breakfast here once and that was so so too. Over rated!",0,negative
Their service absolutely stinks.. Food is always brought out cold. The Biscuits that come with gravy were HARD as a rock. I didn't enjoy the breakfast because the entire time everyone else was eating and I was waiting for something that shouldn't of been hard and cold in the first place. Really not the best breakfast and its false advertising to say so. Two thumbs down...,0,negative
"I am not going to say much, never paid so much for so little and my breakfast was tasteless to top it off \n\nOn the other hand, The service was nice! \n\nMontreal offer tons of better options to eat that offers much more in terms of taste and quality and $$$$$ \n\nI don't think I'm ever going back..  this place was great before the new owner, you knew what to expect (greasy deliciousness ) and huge portions. Now it's like they trying to hard to be something different but end up being a deception.",0,negative
food sucks...me and a friend order a blt....very salty bacon and they use cabbage instead of lettace....its call a BLT....wtf...there is no cabbage in BLT....\n\nService was average.....food sucks...my other friend had the rotisserie chicken...he was disappointed...\n\nThe food is very expensive for a cafe...I don't recommend....,0,negative
"I didn't think this place lived up to the reviews at all! Pretty disappointed actually. I ordered the french toast and it was barely cooked! Lets say it was lightly seared on each side. Disgusting. And at $10 an order, very disappointing. My husband had the breakfast bowl and he enjoyed that, said it was a bit spicy though and he loves spicy food. For the money, this place is not worth it in my opinion.",0,negative
"This review is for breakfast only.  \n\nUnbelievably bad breakfast. Wobbly table, bad service, had to ask for salt, pepper, napkin and silverware. Cream for coffee was old and curdled, sausage was disgusting, eggs not the way I ordered them. Coffee lousy too. I recommend you eat anywhere but here for breakfast. Seemed like cafeteria food.",0,negative
"Food here was ok. Place was really small, loud and the wait long.  I had the Nutella crepes which where huge but just ok. I swear they used 1/2 jar of Nutella in them. Made them sticky sweet. Other pancakes were not really anything special. The service was really good but I'm not likely to be back since I can get the same from IHOP or original pancake and not have to wait forever for a table.",0,negative
"Now don't expect a great dining experience. Expect a great \""""diner\"""" breakfast at a great price. The French toast is perfect and all egg dishes are awesome. Service was friendly, but the place need some freshening up to get the last star. Again it's a diner in a strip mall and not a fine restaurant.",1,positive
"So I had to get breakfast and lunch menu. By the time I ate it was brunch so it was good reason. I was really hoping it was amazing or worth the drive. It was good but not amazing. Place was trendy, very new scene downtown chic. \n\nI'll give it second try and try more items. I can't nor want to judge this place by the 3 items I tried. For now I give it a 2. For now.",0,negative
"Overrated. The waffles were not that good (avoid the sausage and gravy waffle at all costs) and the service wasn't stellar either. Like other yelpers I also noticed the fly issue they seem to have...\n\nThe only reason I didn't give them one star is because their coffee was decent. If you want a great breakfast, head over to dor-stop.",0,negative
"Went to breakfast a couple of weeks ago with friends. It wasn't anything to write an awesome review about. I had the egg/mushroom omelet. I was a little runny, but I think it was because they got my order wrong the first time and rushed to make me another. I might go back and try other things, but it's also a bit over-priced so maybe not. When there are endless choices of breakfast places, I would go back if others were going there. I probably wouldn't suggest it.",0,negative
"Citizens breakfast was average. The eggs were made over medium as requested, but the bacon was not hot and the Tator tots with bell peppers and onions weren't my favorite. I had sourdough toast and it wasn't sliced or buttered. Could have had better at Denny's for a lot less.",0,negative
"First time trying this restaurant, and we won't be back. It took 45 minutes to get breakfast. Water glasses were not refilled, and we weren't asked if we wanted another pot of coffee. The potatoes were lukewarm/cold and hard as bricks. The egg dish was OK. My husband said his biscuits were hard. Not worth the time or money to return when better places are nearby.",0,negative
"Not a fan of the potatoes, they are way too mashed and seasoned with some powder mix of sorts. The pancakes (usually a massive portion) and eggs are alright, while other additions like breakfast sausages and bacon are average. \n\nIt's a shame that this location isn't up to par with all the 'allo! mon coco' hype, I was looking forward to its opening since it's in my area and I thought it'd maybe be better than Eggspectations or Universel... but, nope.",0,negative
I enjoyed a 3 course brunch at Mimosa. We had a good discussion with our waiter about the area and the meal. Nice ambiance and food was top notch. I look forward to trying lunch/dinner in the future.,1,positive
I really enjoy their bruchetta. Their brunch is really good and the mimosas are tasty.,1,positive
"A unique park-like setting, located at the back of a modest farm.  Many lovely things to look at while you wait.  The brunch is served very casually, on paper plates, which seems strange for what is essentially gourmet food, but maybe it keeps the costs down.",1,positive
"I am pleasantly surprised; Who can beat $10 all you can eat buffet, with tasty food. I enjoyed it much. The coffee was weak, but the tea was awesome, the blueberry pancakes was not that great, but everything else was, I even enjoyed the desserts, I was pleasantly surprised for sure.  I read many of the reviews here and I am just floored at how unbelievable people are, this is a ten dollar brunch on a Sunday, what do you expect,  well I did not expect the food to be so good, but it was...",1,positive
"I have never eaten dinner here but their brunch is off the chain! it's $15 all you can eat and includes a breakfast beverage of your choice. I'd choose the frozen mimosa! The mac and cheese is sooooo cheesy and creamy! I love that you can also have bagel,lox,and cream cheese and they have onions,capers,eggs,and tomatoes to add to the breakfast sandwich. They also have the usual-bacon,eggs,sausage,eggs benedict,waffles. I love coming here for brunch!",1,positive
"First time here, really wanted brunch but didn't realize they only have it on Sundays. Had their local grass fed burger and it was delicious. Full bar with a great draft list and located in a really quaint house style setting.",1,positive
Great place for Sunday brunch. Blood Mary's very good.,1,positive
"Brunch food is cold, didn't get drinks refilled once. But the homemade tortillas are soooo good!!! As are the churros... Not having drink specials for brunch probably won't bei g me back to this place...",0,negative
I came here for the fixed Sunday brunch menu.\n\nThere are some fun things to try but I did not feel it was worth the $50 price.  If they brought it down to $35 or $40 I'd be more into it but spending $60+ dollars each after (if you get a drink) seems really ridiculous for Sunday brunch.,0,negative
"I enjoyed The Sunday Brunch. The Lobster eggs Benedict, green New Zealand Clams, juicy duck meat, and white chocolate marshmallows. All are wonderful tasty treats.\nOverlooking the water fountains and exceptional personal service; hats off to Chef Hiew:)",1,positive
"Went to Lazy Jane's for brunch this morning (around 1pm). \n\nGet there as early as you can! They ran out of a number of dishes and the scone selection was sparse. Also, they needed to restock the water glasses, and they ran out of forks, apparently due to a dishwasher malfunction. Eating the seitan hash with plastic cutlery is a little challenging =) \n\nBUT The food and atmosphere are still amazing. And I had the vanilla almond coffee. OMG! Yum!",1,positive
"Have only been for brunch on Sundays.  But I think they do it best.  Service is 5 star, food is 5 star.  Seating inside and out, although outside in summer can be okay as the sun doesn't hit their seating until about 1-2.  Mussels are awesome, Oeuf and Boudin Blanc is amazing.  Good cheese selection and seafood selection.  Wine and drink selection also suits all.  If brunch is a must for you, this is the top of the list.",1,positive
"Great Sunday brunch. Excellent breakfast, excellent dinner. Trendy, yet quality food. I like this place.",1,positive
"Bottomless Sunday brunch was just ok. The food was typical bulk standard and most dishes were lukewarm. We were with a large party, so a hefty gratuity was already included despite the subpar service.  The Bloody Mary was below average, so I would skip the bottomless option. Overall, the brunch buffet was way overpriced for simple, average food quality and mediocre service. Two stars because it is 'good for large groups'.",0,negative
"Lunch with the girls?  Want to impress your Mother-in-Law? Show that snobby co-worker what's up? Chelsea's is it!\n\nYumyumyum!  The food is unbeatable.  Fresh and hip, with traditional roots.  We had brunch fare: Perfectly cooked eggs, potatoes that melted like butter, sausage heaven. \n\nYour order will be served up with class by the fabulous wait staff.  Oh and the location!  Natural beauty abounds.  I can't wait to come back.",1,positive
"Met a work acquaintance for lunch here a couple weeks ago. I was leery of the \""""lobster mac and cheese\"""" having been let down by a similarly titled entree at another local establishment. My reservations were unfounded, as they really came through with a delicious bowl of pasta laced with a variety of rich, wonderful cheeses and a healthy amount of sweet, sweet lobster. Served a tasty Mocha as well on a cool early winter's afternoon.\n\nCan't wait to head back for a deeper dive into the breakfast/brunch faire.",1,positive
"When your in Vegas for 24 hours, its the first time your parents meet her parents, and your starving, this place works for a champaign brunch. I had eggs. she had something else, the Mumm Napa flowed, and things went well. Food was pretty good too.",1,positive
"We went downstairs for the Sunday brunch compliments of the 2 free buffet coupons received as part of our postcard offer.   The brunch proved to be, as expected, a disappointment with everything of mediocre quality.  I sampled shrimp cocktail, Mongolian grilled chicken and vegetables, chow fun and (3) itty bitty desserts.  I felt it was overpriced because of the lack of variety and quality in comparison to their regular breakfast buffet.",0,negative
"My sister lives on Piedmont Row and we have been to Brio several times.  We have yet to be disappointed.  The waitstaff is always very attentive and the food is very good.  It can be a little bit of a wait on certain weeknights and weekends, but they do a very good job of managing their tables and getting you in as quickly as possible.  I will go again and again!",1,positive
"Very disappointed with brunch here. I ordered the Eggs Benedict.  The eggs were overcooked (cooked all the way through, no running yolk), and they used very little hollandaise sauce. If a restaurant with the word \""""egg\"""" in its name cannot make a decent Eggs Benedict, you know it's a bad restaurant.  \n\nIf the yolk doesn't run, I run.",0,negative
This place was great.\n\nI went on a sunday for brunch. I thought it was going to be small judging from the outside but it turned out to have a surprisingly big. Really good atmosphere especially upstairs. They had piano music playing and I actually wasn't sure if someone was playing live. I don't think there was.\n\nFood was delicious. I got the biscuits with gravy. Potatoes were definitely unique and great. Drinks were also very refreshing. Will be back many times in the future,1,positive
"Went to Envy for the Sunday Brunch.  It was a pleasant surprise.  The selection was smaller due to it being in the steakhouse, but the quality was very good.  The price includes unlimited champagne, mimosas and for Bloody Mary fans, they have a nice make your own Bloody Mary bar.  It was very busy but the service was still good.  Much nicer on the inside than the outside looks.",1,positive
"Brunch is not good here. Stick to baked goods. Quiche was so cold in the middle, had to be either frozen or stored in refrigerator for very long time. Not anywhere close to freshly made. Croque Monsieur also pretty sad, thin slices of lunch meat style ham, soggy bread and pretty bland all things considered. The coffee is also deplorable, tasting of ash, turpentine, and a touch of tar. Service was pretty good though.",0,negative
"Such a pleasant place for brunch! They have great brunch dishes and large selection of coffee. The please usually nicely packed, with laid back patrons with their cup of coffee reading newspaper or thick Satre. The seating is tight, but cozy.\nThe food came in large plates, enough to really cramp the small table for two. The savory dish we ordered came with over cooked veggie, and dead poached apple, the sweet chocolate crepes loaded with whipped cream. Strangely they were great!",1,positive
"Me  and my friends didn't want to wait in the line that was 1 hour + across the street so we came here for brunch. I got their banana crepes and  and my friends had their eggs benedict along with some bloody marys and mimosas. We all thought the food was pretty good. The drinks were so so, but i don't think they are known for their bloodies. Service was good and we sat outside which was nice. Overall we all liked it",1,positive
I am only commenting on the brunch.  It's very pricey given the very limited selection and the quality mediocre at best.  The pastries are pre-packaged and the bacon is way over done.  It was actually burnt. Stay away for the brunch.  I can't speak for the other meals,0,negative
"After rafting at the USNWC, I was craving some OTB chips and salsa, so we had a late lunch on the way home.  We found out OTB has drink specials on the Brunch menu, but those end at 2pm so try to stick to \""""normal\"""" lunch hours on the weekend to get the best bang for your buck.  That being said, the lunch menu is active until 4pm and it includes some discounts on the normal dinner entrees.",1,positive
"Really nice Brunch.   There was a line but we had reservations and were seated immediately.  Our waitress was terrific.  She stopped by with the specials to show us what was available.  Very attentive and helpful.  W had the Brunch that included a cream filled crepe with berry puree, eggs provencale, and beautiful croissant.  We did have to ask for the berry puree because the kitchen forgot to put it on the plate and it was oh so good!  \n\nThe duck confit was melt in you mouth tasty!",1,positive

"This is the first time we took our daughter for brunch and it was such a different place, of course, then the nighttime or happy hour. The music was quieter, the food was better looking, and tasted better. I will totally do brunch again! My daughter loved it! My only reason for not giving 5 was because the service was just okay, we needed drinks and waited forever. Also their prices are very high for a brunch.",1,positive
"Food was cold and dry, waffles over cooked, pancakes under cooked, price of $30 for brunch DEFINITELY NOT WORTH IT.\n\nBetter selection of desserts, but odd combinations of fruit soured their taste.",0,negative
"Definitely a decent brunch spot.  The parking lot is super small, but they offer complimentary valet.  I absolutely loved the verde bloody mary!  So delicious.  I think I'll go back just for that!  The food is good too.  Not amazing, but definitely really good.  I'd happily go back again anytime!",1,positive
"Met a friend for brunch and about died over how good it was. All you need to know is the following:\n\n1. You can get a pitcher of Pimm's Cup. A pitcher.\n2. Best Eggs Benedict since the old El Chorro on Lincoln. No offense to the new El Chorro, I just stopped going after you stomped all over your history with the remodel.\n3. Griddled Church Potatoes\n\nI am in LOVE with Windsor. Probably going to eat there so much it gets weird.",1,positive
"was at the brio tonight food was great  alittle  pricey,,,",1,positive
My Sunday ritual consists of sauntering into this establishment and doing the city paper crossword (in pen and I can't spell). Bummed they cut back the brunch menu but it is still a clutch brunch spot (and it's safely away from the masses lined up outside of Pamela eagerly waiting to get their fix of butter soaked everything with a side of afternoon diarrhea).,1,positive
"We went here for Mothers Day Brunch and Had a wonderful meal!! They had fresh crab legs, oysters, salmon, shrimp and fish . They also had breakfast items as well. The french toast was delicious!! There was also a carving station and desserts. This was the second week for the brunch. It as 18.00 per adult plus drinks and 9.00 for kids which inculded drinks!  Awesome!!",1,positive
"Great atmosphere to enjoy a Sunday brunch! Wait was not bad they will text you when table is ready. Portion vs price ratio was good. We had fresh orange juice and coffee, banana nut flapjacks and the Mr. Had eggs Benedict with delicious hash browns! Will definitely be back again.",1,positive
This place was terrible. The pictures I saw on yelp did not match what was on the menu and the staff was awful. To top it off screaming kids and you can't even have a mimosa with your brunch.,0,negative
The ambience is good.  I ordered the John's steak and eggs for brunch.  It's delicious.,1,positive
"After looking at this place for a year, I finally decided to stop in. My brunch was amazing. I had the cronut (a very sweet croissant donut mix) which was pretty good. But then I got the bacon egg and cheese croissant and it was amazing. It was actually a stuffed croissant filled with the the BEC instead of being made like a typical sandwich. The other people in our party had it on sourdough and were envious of the croissant so I would recommend the latter.",1,positive
"Loved it! Went for brunch Sep 2014. Loved the vibe, food, and cheap drinks. I had to indulge my sweet tooth and have the french toast with plaintains. It was amazeballs. My boyfriend had a salad with tuna and he enjoyed it as well. Can't wait to go back.",1,positive
Noticed a few reviews complaining about cold French onion soup so I brought that up with the Waiter he assured me it would be hot so I tried it off course it came out cold.  Didnt think the flavor was to good.  Ordered chicken salad  sandwich and it was whole wheet croissant. Why would some want a healthy croissant that makes no sense and why would the menu not explain that.,0,negative
"Scones are outrageously good. So is the SCC. They have recently been experimenting with not calling your name\nout, which is a nice change, makes it quieter.",1,positive
EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!\n\nworst crepe ever!! i got the standard nutella with berries/cream....it was disgusting!,0,negative
Wasn't like it used to be. I had the nutella crepe. It was crispy instead of soft and pillowy. I'm surprised to say that there was too much nutella to crepe ratio. Banana was fresh. Whipped cream was awesome as before. It's not the same as it used to be.,0,negative
Horrible breakfast croissant ever!!  Might have had sand in it. Don't wast your money!,0,negative
"If I could give 0 stars I would. They always take a really long time to make crepes.  The ingredients are not fresh.  My last and final visit I had the older Asian guy making my 3 crepes. He was very rude.  He made on crepe handed it to me then rang other guests. Walked in the back, made the drink orders for several other guests. Then, made the second crepe and again same thing with the 3rd crepe.  \nThey need to get training on how to make crepes.  My advice is go to Bellagio and watch how they make crepes.",0,negative
"Ordered a strawberries and chocolate crepe.  Crepe was not the best tasting.  Had strawberry \""""puree\"""" in it as well as nutella.  The nutella was a nice hazelnut flavor, but that \""""puree\"""" was effen disgusting.  Tasted like the filling for a Pillsbury Toaster Strudel...that mixed with the nutella was AWFUL.\n\nWill never go back for that.  I might return to try some gelato or one of the many coffee drinks.",0,negative
"Crema is great! This is our favorite neighborhood place for breakfast. The ingredients are fresh and high quality. It costs a little bit more than your typical greasy spoon, but the taste and quality make up for it.",1,positive
"I'm glad the intoxicating sweet aroma of crepes doesn't make it out beyond the front door or else this quaint little place would be packed, with nowhere to sit. Luckily, it was a Tuesday morning so we shared our brunchtime with just a handful of other lucky patrons. Great cozy atmosphere, tasty yummies and lovely, gratious service.",1,positive
We orders crepes and cheese fondue with sundry tomato. We are so full after all. The crepes are nice. I don't like the taste of the cheese fondue (probably the taste of wine or sundry tomato). I like that they have so many choices on crepes.,1,positive
Seriously tasty crepes! Breakfast and lunch crepes were tasty and produce was fresh and delightful,1,positive
"Ok, so this business is currently run from a mobile kitchen.  Now I do mean that it is a kitchen.  The crepes are made to order, the ingredients are absolutely fresh and delicious.  They are currently going to various farmers markets, Old Town Scottsdale and Awatuke,  and going to private parties when they are asked.  \nSo when you have the chance to find where they are and try them.  You won't be disappointed at all.  They are great.  \nAlso check then out on twitter.",1,positive
these macron's are amazing and there custard stuffed croissants are sooo good too. \n$1 a piece for the macrons \n$2 for a croissant,1,positive
"This place popped up a little over a week after my first visit to the MGM this year, and one evening after dinner I was craving something sweet so I came down to grab a crepe to take back to my room. The girl behind the counter was super helpful, and I decided on getting a nutella crepe with strawberries. These are certainly not cheap, my crepe ran me about $11, but at the time it was worth every penny :)",1,positive
"This is a small, no-nonsense creperie with a wide selection of items. I wanted to get something light and the associate at the counter was able to convert their Florentine Crepe into an omelet for me. The portion size was more than sufficient and the food tasted fresh. It's a great spot--very clean and they use compostable and recyclable cups, plates etc.",1,positive
"I got the exotice fruit crepe which was good.  It came with a scoop of coconut gelato.  I thought the geleto taste better than the crepe.  Its about $15 for a crepe here, which I thought was a lil pricey.  I think the next time, I'll just go to Paris hotel for crepes.  But the gelato here was great.  The coconut gelato had lil bit of coconut pieces in it and it was sooo creamy.",1,positive
"-soggy rubbery crepe\n-cheap oj, tastes like minute maid\n-Potatoes gratin tastes cheap with a Mac n cheese flavor\n\nI wanted something classic so I got the maple cream crepe with coffee and oj and a side of Potatoes. Maple syrup wasn't high quality. I won't be back.",0,negative
"The croquet Madame was delicious! I was surprised by the serving size, I couldn't finish the whole sandwich. The fresh made bread was great, soft & slightly dense inside and really made the sandwich. The egg was cooked perfectly (something I've found to be a variable at many restaurants). I also got a white mocha coffee it was very good as well.",1,positive
"I was happy with my crepe and fruit cup. My crepe was made with fresh fruit to include berries, bananas, Nutella, whipped creme and a raspberry syrup. I was uber satisfied and a happy camper!",1,positive
"This place has a good atmosphere and their crepes are wonderful.  I recommend the tropical crepes, because the nutella crepes is too chocolately unless you are a big fan of chocolate.  The chipotle crepes is really delicious and if you want coffee their hazelnut and mocha are good too.",1,positive
