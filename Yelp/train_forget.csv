"For a furniture store this place gets a score of zero stars as they don't have any.\n\nAs a home decor store I give it a two, because at least they carry those items, atrocious as they may be to the senses. \n\nWe walked in and right out, as the smell of something (candles? Potpourri? Formaldehyde?) was so overwhelming I had to get out of there ASAP. \n\nMaybe you'll have better luck or not as sensitive of nostrils. Regardless, definitely not a furniture shop.",0,negative

check it out I was taking my family and some friends to eat and was finishing smoking my cigarette in the parking lot. I was told I could not smoke on the lot. Won't be eating here again. In Goodyear Az,0,negative
"Stayed here four times over five years. Each time it got worse. Was assigned a smoking room when we specifically asked for nonsmoking. They had a convention and said no other rooms were available.

"Went today... Pretty slow but service was terrible. Waited quite a while for my hookah, asked for an extra coal because I was short on time and they don't start it for you. Had to wait another ten minutes while I waited for them to heat the coal on a burner, rather than other places that get it smoking for you and have coals ready out back. I go to lounges for the service, if I wanted to take care of it myself I would just smoke at home. Will not be back.",0,negative

I was at the joker last night with a good friend of mine.  \nWhen we came in no body said hello so we took a sit.  \nWe waited for 10-15 min for attention. \nThe hookah didn't last long and didn't have a lot of flavor or smoke.  \nWe usually go to a deferent hookah lounge but we were around there so we wanted to try this place.  We didn't like it as we'll because it is sooo loud.,0,negative
"If I could give a 0 star, I would.  This tribe has no respect for those who don't smoke.  There is not ONE single non-smoking area in the whole place....not even in their Cholla fine dining restaurant (see separate review) which is a definite 4 star.\n\nNever again!",0,negative
Looked great online and decided to go in!! My friends and I were looking for somewhere fun and relaxing to go... Got to say I was pretty disappointed!

If you hate the smell of cigarette and incense don't stay here. WiFi is not free ($11.99) at all as advertised.  The room keys does'n't work most of the time and I had mine replaced twice today.

Great place to get your smog check done. I was there during lunch time. From start to finish it took 10 min. There is a coupon online from their website.

After a year of weekly coffee dates with my husband and meeting friends and clients here we refuse to go back because of a group of business owners from a local shop who seem to just hang out there all day and smoke within the legal boundaries and they don't seem to be able to control these repeat offenders. If they can't control these repeat offenders we won't be back. Sad because we really liked this store.,0,negative

They had a ladies night here a few weeks back. A male review. The facility is old and needs to be re done. \nLike the first reviewer it definitely has a smell. I'm not sure of balls and ashtray but its something alright. I'll pass on the next event they offer here.,0,negative

Stay away!  My room reeked of cigarette smoke even though it was supposed to be non-smoking.  I couldn't sleep there but was told no other rooms available.

"I have generally had good experiences with clean air cab- on time, easy to book... I also like that the fleet is consistent (Prius, not random personal cars). But my cab this morning wreaked so badly of cigarettes, I could literally smell it as I was approaching the cab. Now I smell of cigarettes as I am about to get on my plane.

Attempted yesterday evening. . This is a smokers paradise.  There is no way for a non smoker to escape. . This appeared to be an all outdoor patio experience.

My husband and I truly are lovers of this brand however I think it is a flawed process. The drive thru line on any given day is 10-20 minutes which seems very long to me for what should be a faster experience than say walking in grabbing a table and sitting to enjoy your coffee. The employees are very friendly and the coffee is amazing. Just steer clear of the drive thru if you are in a hurry.,0,negative
These must be the most miserable employees at any Starbucks I've ever been to. Not friendly at all. Customer service? Seriously lacking. So why do I come here? Desperation or if I didn't have time to make it to a Starbucks before work. And the coffee is good. At least they get that right.,0,negative
"This is by far the best Starbucks I've been to in Vegas customer service wise. I've never had a problem with any of my orders and believe me I stop by often since it is so close to work.

"Eww I will never go late night here for coffee. I was even scared to use the bathroom here. There are people hanging outside of the coffee house in the late night which makes it look ghetto.

Not the best Starbucks experience I've ever had.   Messy and slow.,0,negative

It will be awhile before I return to this location, which is a shame since it's so close to me.",0,negative

"This is not the closest Starbucks to me, but it's the closest one with a drive-through... and sometimes I'm just that lazy!

This place is hit or miss. On occasion I'll get served by a really good barista. Great personality. Super friendly. And very helpful. Every other time I've ever been here I get the grumpy barista. The one who wants to charge for everything. Like an EXTRA CINNAMON charge! Baristas like that make me change my mind after I ordered my drink for being bitchy because I wasn't fast enough with my response in how many espresso shots I wanted. I just think a majority of the females that work here suck at their job.,0,negative
Starbucks is just disgusting coffee in general wherever you go. One time I ordered an iced mocha and it ended up being some watered down coffee with a bunch of chocolate syrup floating at the bottom. Idk about you but that's disgusting. They always put way too much ice in the coffee too even after I ask them not to as well. Overall do yourself the favor and just stay away from Starbucks coffee. Local places are usually a lot better.,0,negative

I definitely have experienced better, and hence the 2 stars.",0,negative
"This is the worst Starbucks I have ever gone to. They finally got rid of the disgusting couches that were a hang out spot for homeless people, but there is still a seedy crowd that hangs out around the store.

I didn't notice it being any quicker than any other Starbucks. I avoid this store from now on.",0,negative

"Sigh. I really hate it that I like Starbucks coffee better than the local guys, but in most cases it's true. Still looking for my perfect latte in Madison at a mom & pop shop. Definitely didn't find it at Espresso Royale. My latte tasted like it was made with kerosene instead of espresso.\n\nThe staff were friendly and the ambiance was fine, but if I've gotta buy something to get the free wifi, I want it to go down easy.",0,negative
"Of all the Starbucks I have ever been to...this is one of them.  Clean, standard friendly staff, good drinks.\n\nNot much else to say, if you like Starbucks, this is right up your alley!",1,positive
"I've been here only a few times and the staff was really rude all of the times. Today they crossed the line when they refused to refill my drink with the rewards program. They did not offer to make it right and handled the situation very unprofessionally.\n\nIf you are in the area, make sure to go to the Starbucks in Rock Hill, just down the I-77 instead of this hole.",0,negative
"There is nothing outstanding from this Starbucks that differentiates it from another great Starbucks. Drive-Thru is speedy, the Barista are friendly, and the beverages are up to Starbucks standards. \n\nInside is moderately sized, and any time I've been in here - the environment has been realitvely quiet. I just wish maybe the music wasn't so loud, but that's easily remedied by headphones!",1,positive
"The staff is always friendly at this Starbucks and they have always been super professional and helpful even when I do not know exactly what I want to order.  Most importantly to me, this has been a nice location to meet my buddies in the morning and grab an early coffee.  Of course once 7am rolls around, I head on down to New York Flavor a few units away as they have more of a breakfast menu and I think a tastier brew of coffee.  But sometimes I cannot wait until 7, so Starbucks it is.",1,positive

"Oh how far the mighty fall.\n\nWhile the hip factor on this place has gone up and down over the years, at least they had semi-decent coffee. I went there today, and now even that's dead. It tasted like pencil shavings. And not those yummy, creamy pencil shavings either. They were the kinds you get from a pencil. Steeped in boiling water.\n\nIt's no wonder the place is usually abandoned. Well, that and all of the Starbuck's in every corner of the Earth...",0,negative
This Starbucks is amazing because the baristas are always hustling! They are personable and always willing to do what is right! They fill orders with a quickness too! Libby and Keven are always willing to chat with me during my nightly stop. Their smiles can make anyone happy! I was disappointed when I moved to first shift and knew I wouldn't see them anymore.,1,positive

Great customer service. -1 for no outlets tho! but the manger is so nice!!! she remembers you and is super friendly great awesome customer service!!!",1,positive

The worst Starbucks I've ever been to and it's too bad it's the closest to my home. You can count on your drink leaking ALL over the place and a cup full of ice. I watched the cup being halfway filled with coffee then a GIANT scoop of ice overflowing the top of my drink then they squeezed the lid on my cup with all the coffee coming out of the top and leaking all over the side of my cup. Not good.,0,negative
"This is one of my favorite Starbucks locations. They are super friendly, get your drink order right the first time, and they're fast!",1,positive
"Coffee and atmosphere are great... but my God, the cupcakes are the worst EVER!!!  There is a bakery right beside them; they should really consider selling the bakery's sweets or none at all.  I think a fake/display cupcake would have been fresher... and maybe even taste better.  Yes, it was that bad!  Mr. Manager... try your stuff before you sell it!",0,negative

For whatever reason I can't make a decent frappuccino at home..",1,positive
"I love Starbucks and I love my coffee but this one sucked. The customer service was awful. The girl that took our order was horrible, she didn't smile once and had an attitude. Nobody looked happy. Im used to Starbucks employees being more welcoming and friendly. What a depressing place. Im surprised its got good ratings. Maybe it was an off day, who knows.",0,negative
"I may be friendly but I will probably never be Dutch Brothers Friendly. Evertime I go to this location everyone is always super nice, my coffee is always delicious, and I some how always get sucked into an awesome conversation with the workers.

Too expensive! Casino owned (Harrahs). Double the price of a regular corporate owned Starbucks.,0,negative
I like dunkin'  but the service sucks ..  The cashier was rude but I would be too if I had that job. \n\n\n\n\nShe messed up on our order didn't go back to change it because it would've been a waste of time she probably would've messed up on that as well. \n\nJust left dunkin' 20min ago!,0,negative
"I refuse to purchase Starbucks! They have terrible, bitter, and burnt tasting coffee. Dutch Bros is fast, friendly, and has more variety with Soy and Coconut Milk for alternatives! The coffee is way better and the people make you leave with a smile!",1,positive
This is by far the WORST Starbucks that I kno of... I've never sat in a line so long before just got a coffee.... I was in line for over 20 mins a few times and they never say thanks for waiting how may I take your order they just go straight into ordering.. So I said when I approached the window what's the hold up...?? And the guy said well we only have three people working..... If it's busy then just hire more people you kno???? My gosh it's horrible horrible horrible.....,0,negative

I mean, please-- beyond the \""""fair trade\"""" gimmick what distinguishes this place at all from any coffee shop on state street (or any other street in the USA)?\n\n$2 surcharge=unacceptable.",0,negative
good prompt service and the baristas know what they're doing here.,1,positive
"These employees appear to be poorly trained and aggressively unfriendly, a deadly combination.\n\nI would never think to write a review for a Starbucks, because they are so consistent in their quality of beverages and presentation skills. \n\nIn addition to attitude and demeanor problems of the staff, my beverage and the subsequent refill were both prepared incorrectly, adding to my initial negative impression.  \n\nThe corrections were made, but with an attitude.\n\nThis is the worst Starbucks I have ever been to.",0,negative
"I went there once. The food was overpriced, underdelicious, and what I mostly remember was that it took FOREVER. It was brunch time on a Saturday morning, but even taking that into consideration, there's no reason it should have taken 15 minutes for me to get my coffee. If I remember correctly, my companion didn't even get her drink until asking the waitress several times.",0,negative
"Located in the food court/student union at UNLV, this Starbucks is my least favorite location.\n\nEvery time I have gone there is a line. It ranges from 5-30 people, and moves slowly.\n\nThey won't redeem the free drinks and food items I have earned on my Starbucks card. I get that this location is on a campus, but it's still annoying.\n\nThey've been out of ingredients on several occasions.",0,negative
This is the best starbucks we went to in vegas. The staff was quick and friendly and drinks were perfect.,1,positive

"What a shithole of a place\n\nNo internet\nNo wall outlets\nDoes not take employee discounts\nLong wait for drinks even when you're the only one there and there are 3 people working. \n\nAvoid it like the plague. If you want coffee, go to the McDonalds a few steps away.",0,negative
"What can really be said about starbucks that hasn't already? What seems to be 10 years ago awesome coffee has turned into todays \""""meh... ive had better.\""""\n\nThis is the location inside the safeway.

"Two stars for being open 24 hours and conveniently located.  Besides that, I have never been to another starbucks that consistently screws up my drink. How can you screw up an iced coffee with toffee nut syrup? I keep giving them chances and they keep screwing it up every time, I don't get it.  These people need some training in not only making drinks but also listening to what is being ordered!",0,negative
Always mixing up my order and they aren't friendly about fixing it either. I actually drive farther to avoid this Starbucks even though it's on my way to the freeway. It used to be good but I think the good employees moved on. The Starbucks north of the 215 on Rainbow is way better.,0,negative
"I don't like writing bad reviews, but this place is the worst. Their donuts are ok. That's not the problem. The problem is for the past month their latte machine has been \""""down\"""".

It shouldn't be that difficult.",0,negative
"Really slow baristas!! Some are standing around !! Maybe they're on break but then, they should hang around where the customers can't see them !!it just looked like a bunch of no good employees ( looks that way) if they're in the same area and it's busy not doing anything",0,negative
Only one barista here. Takes FOR EVERYTHING to get your coffee. I do have to say that the barista was very nice and did her best. But ONE employee for this Starbucks??? Really?!,0,negative
There are hundreds of Starbucks' all over town but this particular one is my favorite. I have never had a problem there and the employees are very friendly! They have a comfortable seating area and a calm setting which is exactly what I like in the morning.,1,positive
This place is horrible! The Hispanic lady in the morning give the entire store (employees) coffee before she even helps customers. Today I was in line forever and finally walked out.,0,negative
"Staff is really nice, but the problem is that they put ice into their hot coffee and then called it \""""iced coffee.\"""" Sure, the location is convenient, especially for ASU grad students, but Starbucks at the MU is worth the wait in comparison.

"OK, so I guess I will call this the world's slowest Starbucks. And I have to agree with the other Yelper who reviewed this location since they got my order wrong as well. while I appreciate friendly and good customer service, it seems that the cashier was more concerned with socializing amongst her colleagues. I didn't think that \""""Chai\"""" sounds remotely like \""""Mocha\""""\n\nI still dig Starbucks, especially the marble and pumpkin cakes. I'll just stick to my other spots.",0,negative
"Fast, friendly service. Consistent on the drinks. Drive thru is convenient and fairly quick.\n\nStarbucks isn't my first choice in coffee but their iced teas are great!",1,positive
"I don't like to write negative reviews but this place is so dysfunctional and unorganized. They took forever to make my wife's peppermint mocha, i handed them the empty creamer so they could refill it for not just me but the next guy. Fast forward couple minutes later I'm still waiting, I asked how much longer it was going till be to fill up the creamer...I get handed a cup with cream in it? Note to self, take advantage of a Starbucks being on every corner and go to another one next time.",0,negative

Thankfully (or not so thankfully, depending on how you look at it) the HT on Central has a brand new Starbucks, and those guys over there are pretty friendly and make fantastic iced coffee. Generally going to get coffee makes me a happier person, but sadly, getting it at the 7th street location has an entirely opposite effect.",0,negative

I really wanted to love this new location but I feel like every time I go in to the location or through the drive thru something is always something wrong! It's so annoying either the coffee is gross or I order a sandwich or bagel and later they tell me they don't have the ingredients for the sandwich or no bagels.,0,negative
"All coffee experts at Starbucks are friendly, and this one is no different.  Very quick and friendly - always nice to grab a quick drink before browsing the Target store for purchases.",1,positive
This is my favorite starbucks. The employees here are friendly and they are pretty quick considering it is *never* not busy. I went today and sat on the patio and had a yogurt parfait and a cup of coffee. It was very enjoyable.,1,positive
"This Starbucks sucks. In terms of cleanliness and quality... It's fine. Standard. But the PRICE. It costs almost as much as eating at a normal breakfast place. Also I just really needed a cup of water and got told it's $.75 for water. Awesome Starbucks. I will go down the way and eat at an actual restaurant if I am going to pay $35 for 2 breakfast sandwiches, 2 drinks and some water.",0,negative
"It's the bare minimum that you would expect from Starbucks. I have never been able ti order a breakfast sandwich because they always run out before 10am. When asked how many sandwiches they usually carry the lady told me only 7! No wonder they always run out. They are only good for making you a drink at a mediocre pace. And don't expect much from these baristas, They have a sense of entitlement to the place that subtly overwhelms the customer service. Handle the stress ladies, its just a coffee shop.",0,negative
"I get so sad when Smaba is closed. I propose you guys stay open til midnight 7 days a week. Some of us need coffee late and I die when I am subjected to that junk served at Starbucks :( Maybe I should just buy a coffee machine, but it won't help.",1,positive
"Great Location but slow service.  I am waiting just ice coffee 15 minutes. Now, not much customers are  here.",0,negative
I travel to other Starbucks locations whenever possible even though this one is closest to my It is okay but there locations that have firendlier staff and just look cleaner. They were willing to brew bold which some other locations won't do after 12 noon. There are times when they would not brew a tank but would offer a pour over which I don't want as much as I don't want Pike Place. I will drink McDonald's coffee before I drink Pike Place.

i like their iced coffee more than starbucks.  the staff at this location were super nice.,1,positive
"Terrible customer service.  I think they burned my drink because I sent it back.  I said no ice and it felt like everyone rolled their eyes.  Starbucks should have a laid back feel, not a diva feel.  Wanna be a diva?  Drink rockstar and quit Starbucks.  Love lattes though.  :)",0,negative

I love this starbucks!!! I go to it at least 4 days out of my five day work week!!!

As I waited, I watched the only guy actually working wipe the sweat off his forehead with the same hand he was using to make drinks and grab the lids from underneath. Disgusting!! My latte tasted horrible and was definitely a waste of $4. Though I rarely visit Starbucks anyway, I will never be back to this location.",0,negative

"I've stopped at this outlet a few times and I enjoy it quite a bit.  There's a good amount of table space and the wifi is available as it is at all Starbucks.\n\nThe only drawback to this location is its location.

Once you know, though, it's OK.",1,positive
"Great Drive-Thru Starbucks, but does congest traffic a little on Bethel.",1,positive
"I have driven by this location many times.  My daughter wanted to try the vanilla chai latte that I typically share with her.  The staff members were kind and friendly.  However, when the drinks were served, they were not hot but cool.  I have no words to describe how disappointed we were.  I didn't bother to go back in.  If your workers are not properly trained to do their job, they cannot provide the customer service expected.",0,negative
"This Starbucks sucks. First off, the girl rushed me and somehow thought I was done ordering, (interrupted me and told me my price) \""""um, I'm not done ordering.\"""" How rude. They also took forever and didn't even make my drink correct. Such bullshit. Never coming back to this location.",0,negative
Rude customer service and they denied me something every other Starbucks has always offered no problem.,0,negative
"Seriously the worst and rudest morning staff in the world... And I gave this location SEVERAL (Like 30) chances and visits. I used to go here every morning before work for my coffee. The last straw was when I sat in front of the drive-thru window for almost 20 mins before someone finally opened the window to hand me my coffee, then proceeded to argue with me about how much change I get back after handing her a $20 bill. I would say 25 out of 30 times I went there, I had a terrible experience. Never again!",0,negative
COOL:\n- Plenty of seating.\n- Plenty of power.\n- Full of activity.\n- Free wifi if you have AT&T Wireless at home.\n\nUNCOOL:\n- Long lines.\n- No breakfast sandwiches.\n- Bathroom requires a key?  I guess that's typical Starbucks.,0,negative
Good Starbucks. Friendly staff. Very clean. Pastry case filled.\n\nMy drink came quick and correct. \n\nOnly comment is that it's a fairly small store with all small tables. So larger groups cannot sit together.,1,positive
"The patio is right next to a bus stop and also right next to four lanes of loud traffic. Not sure which is worse, but bus people might take the cake and that includes random homeless dudes shuffling through the garbage while you attempt to enjoy coffee.

The people at this location are always nice and do a great job!  Thanks Starbucks!,1,positive
"By far the worst starbucks I've been to. Not only did my drink take extremely long, I couldn't believe how dirty the area was where they were making the drinks. It was disgusting!  On top of that I ordered and payed for a venti and received a grande and it tasted like watered down caramel sugar milk. I hate to say I will not be going back there.",0,negative
"The most convenient Starbucks, but unfortunately, management needs to spend more time with their employees. Got my name name wrong after spelling out (MARTIN is not a difficult name to spell), asked for several pastries and got served one, and apparently a caramel macchiato doesn't have caramel at this location. On a positive note, I got a beautiful smile from one of the beautiful girls working there, which is the reason for the one star.",0,negative

Went here for the first time the other day. I actually did not plan on going here but Starbucks was way overcrowded. I decided to go to Caribou as it was nearby and I needed my coffee fix.

"The staff is always frazzled here or always blissfully unaware of the rush and a sense of urgency. I have to come in 30 minutes before my shift starts down the street to be on time.

Expect to be told \""""we are a busy stores you have to get used to it\"""".\n\nI love Starbucks but this store is managed poorly and the general manager is always unnecessarily loud",0,negative
Drive through takes way too long.\nThe staff is rude and unwelcoming.\nThe amount of coffee you get for the price is terrible.\n\nThere are so many better choices when it comes to coffee! I'm just glad I had a gift card because I wouldn't spend my own money at (this) Starbucks.,0,negative
"Super pricey! Wow!\n\nI know this place is the only coffee joint in The Cosmopolitan, but are you serious?! Seven to Eight bucks for blended drinks?!

"For a large university, this is a pretty good Starbucks.  The staff are friendly and will recognize you if you come in multiple times.

At least they smile at Starbucks when you wait forever.",0,negative
Me and my wife get our coffee here every morning and the staff is awesome and remember our names and drinks and have never gotten it wrong and are verry polite!

I suggest only going there if you have to because, afterall, it is a very convenient location.",0,negative
These must be the most miserable employees at any Starbucks I've ever been to. Not friendly at all. Customer service? Seriously lacking. So why do I come here?

All you have to do is put ice in a cup and add coffee. \n\nAnd as I type this I am now walking up to the counter to tell them they forgot to make my drink.",0,negative
"Everyone loves Starbucks, but sadly at this location has terrible customer service. I walked in, no welcome or anything like everyone usually gets. Stood at the counter and the young girl kept waking back and forth, then cleaned out the drain then finally came to the register and said \""""what would you like?\"""" No how are you or what can I make for you today. Her makeup was completely blacked out eyes, had scars all over her arms and no smile. Definitely wont be returning to this location again. Highly disappointed.",0,negative
Pretty solid for an airport Starbucks. Fast service. Can't complain for limited menu considering it's an airport kiosk.,1,positive
Slowest and most disorganized Starbucks ever! 25 minutes for 2 regular coffees and a pre-made spinach wrap.,0,negative
If I could give them 0 stars I would. There's one nice younger boy who works occasionally. Other than him the staff is full of the rudest set of sorority rejects Starbucks could get. It's obvious they none of them want to be there and their sense of urgency is non existent. Don't go here if your in a rush to work! I avoid this Starbucks and just go to the coffee bean a few minutes out of the way. The few minutes out of the way is still better than waiting 15 minutes for a drink.,0,negative
"GREAT coffee, horrendously slow service with other employees not interested in helping knock down the line. If you are just getting coffee, hit the drive-thru - you'll be less frustrated.",0,negative
"Friendly baristas, and the line usually moves pretty fast. Clean interior with plenty of spaces to sit alone or with a group. Nice cozy chairs positioned in front of the roaring fireplace during the winter. \n\nI'm ambivalent about Starbucks coffee, but since they have a loyalty program and they're everywhere, it's what I usually drink when I buy coffee.",1,positive
This Starbucks is almost always busy. The staff are friendly and fast though so the wait doesn't seem bad. Clean and quick! Nice location.,1,positive
"I had an early morning shift at work, and I thought in my head that I would need some Starbucks. So I looked online for a Starbucks that was open and it said that this one opened at 430. Let's just say, it doesn't open at 430 and the STARBUCKS APP gave me false information. Seriously? Get your things together and don't false advertise. I was quite pissed off about this. Thanks for nothing Starbucks.",0,negative
Sorry Cliff but I get better customer service at any of the other locations.\nDecided I'm not going to be hitting this stop any longer since the manager is charging more for coffee.\nAll of the other locations give you a break on filling your own mug.\nHere they will charge more if your mug even looks big.\nGas is cheaper up the road too.\nI'll just stick with the other locations.,0,negative
"Worst Starbucks I have been to. Both the barista and the cashier were very rude and not helpful. The store was also not clean, there was garbage on the floor and splatters in the counter. When I asked about rewards and promo codes, I quickly got a dismissive \""""no we do not do that\"""" they also don't seem to make many drinks being that they told various customers they couldn't make the drink. My experience with this Starbucks pushed me to go to other coffee retailers during my time in Las Vegas. Avoid going if possible.",0,negative
"The outside starbucks of the fashion show mall... sure it's a cute and a nice location however the employees are rude. I understand that the store gets busy however, many other starbucks when I order a caramel frap they usually put whip cream on it. Not just that, also when other customers are getting their drinks before you when you ordered before them. To sum it up if you want whip make sure you tell them when you're ordering and be prepared for customers behind you to get their drinks way before you do.",0,negative
"Slowest Starbucks ever. When the line is 10 people deep, the barista still only makes one drink at a time. Try to avoid if you can.",0,negative
"The service in this store was poor yesterday.  After visiting Dr. Hammargren's house yesterday, I stopped here for a thirst quencher before going home.  There were four employees working yet it took over 5 minutes to get a drink.  The person making the fraps was overwhelmed by the drive through and the others didn't help her at all.\n\nSurprising for me to give a Starbucks only 2 stars.  I won't stop here again.,",0,negative
Going in to look for a Starbuck's plastic cups.  Didn't find the one we are looking for...  The staff was not so friendly.,0,negative
"The coffee is good, but the customer service is horrible. They usually rush us thru the drive-thru only to get our order wrong almost every time. They are also very rude. We have a Starbucks and a Dunkin close to our house, which one do you think we will go to?",0,negative
"This location is one of my favorites, and while I have two others that are a little closer to my office, I make the effort to walk to this location.  The staff is amazingly friendly.  Also, they can really move customers through so that even with a long line you aren't stuck waiting for too long.  What makes this even better is that you still get that personal connection and friendliness that you hope for when you walk into a Starbucks.",1,positive
"This is the only Starbucks I've ever been to that refused to blend a cake pop into my frap. The employees are nice, but the manager was clearly stingy and claimed that the entire company changed its policies on the'secret menu' (which isn't a secret menu, it's just the things Starbucks allows to customize drinks). This is definitely the last Starbucks I would choose to go to despite it being the closest to my house.",0,negative
"They've opened a new coffee shop in Verrado and a 10 min stop for coffee has turned into a long laborious affair.  If you want to be in a line for 30mins or so come to this place....\nAs for the Indian School location, service needs to be improved.",0,negative
"they close so freaking early!  their brewed coffee is good!  I think it's actually better than starbucks! truly! \n\nI always am served by friendly ppl and am always satisfied with my usual jalapeno bagel with honey butter.  yum. I've also had sandwiches and breakfast sandwiches and those are\nalso very good.  its clean, and their is plenty of seating.. \n\ni like this location and actually plan to hit the one on rainbow tomorrow.. we'll see how that goes.",1,positive
It is the STAFF that makes this place unreal!   We go there a couple times a week and they always know our names and drinks....in a genuine real way.  Super clean and the drinks are always spot on.  A great example of  Starbucks done right!,1,positive
"They got my order started fast and the employees are happy. So am I. Life is good.  I appreciate a business where the employees are happy and friends.  They all seem to get along well, which really helped the environment. Would I say this Starbucks is better than most, yes. Would I go out of my way just to go to this Starbucks, probably not, but I would go back.",1,positive
This Starbucks drive thru has spoiled me on others.  The wait is always less and the team is always friendlier.  The drinks are pretty awesome too.,1,positive
The line was a little long but worth the wait! The staff was very friendly. This is my Starbucks.,1,positive
Love Starbucks. Obviously. Dakota is super sweet and I love when she serves me. My only irk about this location is they don't carry their fat free cream cheese! :(,1,positive
Slow. Slow. Slow. Slow. Slow. Is the slowest moving group of employees a live!  If you want to age while you wait for coffee come here!!!!!   Remember Slow. Slow. Slow. Slow!,0,negative
"Worst service I've ever encountered in a chain coffee company store. Usually I love CBTL, but their employees are unfocused and immature. These guys get my order wrong every time. They've yelled at me from across the room \""""hey, burrito\"""" at me, which feels rude, am I right? I've heard an employee's sexcapades. Not cute. It will be awhile before I return to this location, which is a shame since it's so close to me.",0,negative
"Love the coffee, hate the service. I work in the same shopping center as this location and have gone there frequently, the service keeps getting worse. Most recently, I was sitting down waiting for my bagel and when it was ready, the girl just yelled, \""""cinnamon bagel\"""" and threw the bag on the counter and walked away. Very rude. I'm glad I found a big bag of Dunkin's coffee at Sam's Club so I don't have to go there every morning to get my fix.",0,negative
Finally no line! Was able to pick up a post-pool afternoon coffee today as there was no line. I usually get my coffee in Tower 1 Starbucks. The Baristas were friendly and efficient and my drink was great. I pay with my phone and feel bad that at this Starbucks they have to key in the number manually. \n\nThis location is right by the food court on the main walkway from the casino to the pool (closer to the pool side).\n\nDOS 8/29/14 2pm,1,positive
"My Girl and I have been going to this Starbucks location the last few mornings, I have also been here many times myself and I have to say the staff is great. One man especially stands out and always seems to know many people's names even their children's names. \n\nAs with any Starbucks the coffee is good and the flavors are all same being that it's a chain, but this location is nice with outside seating, and plenty of seating inside.\n\nIf you are in the area, try it.",1,positive
"Starbucks is a Starbucks is a Starbucks . . . except, this is one of the most consistently slow Starbucks I've ever visited.  \n\nWhether there are 3 people in line or 10, it always takes a long time to get a drink.  To be fair to the staff, most of the time I've been here, the customers are ordering multiple drinks.  And I've never seen the place empty.  So the staff seems to be doing the best they can.  But they never seem to catch up.  \n\nSo if you're looking to drop in and grab a quick coffee drink, go elsewhere.",0,negative

This is our closest Starbucks and I visit frequently. Service has always come with a hello and a smile. I've never waited an extraordinary amount of time for any drink/food. Yes there are lines but it's Starbucks... c'mon it's popular. Drinks have always been correct and we're happy with this store! Seating inside is small-ish but it's not a huge Starbucks store anyways. There is outdoor seating in a patio style with a fountain and low volume music.,1,positive
This starbucks seems to be more consistent than most other local Starbucks as far as quality. The staff is always quick with a friendly greeting. They usually have your order ready before you make it to the end of the counter.,1,positive
It's just like every other Starbucks everywhere. This used to be a grocery store. What I do like about this location is that if you get a seat right near the window you can access CMU's wifi. :),1,positive
"This Starbucks is very close to work so very convenient. I absolutely adore this English lady with her even more adorable English accent!!! I love it when she takes my order. Every once in a great while I get a drink that's not mine but they offer a replacement and if I want a free one for next time. Friendly, clean and great service. \""""Can't get that with satellite!\""""",1,positive
Never been to a worse Starbucks.  \nWent to the drive thru and Kim was rude and unfriendly. She was more concerned with continuing the conversation with her coworker. No sense of urgency unlike the other locations I've been to.,0,negative
"Worst Starbucks staff hands down. Waited 15 minutes for a drip coffee while staff stood around, laughed and chatted. When I asked if the coffee was ready, I was told, \""""you need to wait\"""". This is uncharacteristic of Starbucks and I'm surprised to have this bad an experience.",0,negative
Starbucks are great. But the barista (Omar) was a dick. I'll stick to another Starbucks if he is behind the counter.,0,negative
Never going here again. They offer a free coffee when the cardnials win... Just went to redeem it I was told it's no longer valid and its only good for 24 hours. I got the offer at 6 am it's 8:30 pm... Hasn't been 24 hours. Most of the employees are stoned when you go in there and the rest are missing teeth it's gross. No thanks! I'll spend the extra money and go to Starbucks where the coffee tastes better and they hire high quality people to work there.,0,negative
I have been to Starbucks stores all over the world. I think out of all the Starbucks this one is one of the worst. They take forever to do anything. It took them 10+ minutes to get make my drink and I was one of the only people in the store. The staff is rude! I have been completely unimpressed by this Starbucks!,0,negative
"I went to this place expecting so much more, based on other reviews.  There was three employees working and one person in front of me in line.  We stood there for ten minutes before the lady told us she would be \""""right there\"""", as they scurried around doing God knows what.  When she returned there were at least six people in line and from a customer service stand point, she seemed to care less. Prices are not bad and coffee was average.",0,negative
Worse Starbucks in town. People are rude that work here and the drinks are always wrong. Ordered a black tea lemonade and waited 15 minutes when people after were already getting their Frappuccino drinks.,0,negative
"Came in for free coffee day. Who says no to free coffee? Well anyway, I only drink it iced so I had to pay $1. No biggie, I got two. The kids wanted some donuts so I picked up a few. It's been years since I have had an original glazed. It was alright. This location doesn't have the full frying/glazing contraption that I have seen at other locations. They must come in frozen.\n\nIf you need to use the restroom, be sure to ask for the key from the front. Understandable given the location.",0,negative
The staff was rude. The coffee tasted like water. It was WAY over-priced. Would never recommend this place.,0,negative
honestly this starbucks is so slow and sometimes i get lukewarm lattes or incorrect drink orders (mind you. this is the only place that screws up my order and sometimes im just ordering a dopio over ice)\n\nhowever its walking distance from my house and very conveniant and i know all the staff,0,negative
Very slow -- even without a lot of customers -- and very disorganized. You can't pay with the Starbucks app -- they have to take your phone and key in the number by hand!,0,negative
We stopped in on Saturday morning to give this place a shot. Walking in the door you cold tell this store was not ready for business. Secondly it's being managed by a 16 yr old and a group of teens who spent more ime answering their cell phones than taking customer orders. The espresso was terrible and it took them four tries to get four shots out of the machine. The breakfast panini was incorrectly made and had been overlooked. Don't waste your money here.,0,negative
"[Out-of-Towner-Review]\n\nThis by far is my favorite Starbucks (maybe ever)...\n\n...simply because they hung a huge SF Giants flag right above their barista drink-making machine area! Flying the Orange and Black pride, like nobody's business.\n\nThey didn't mess up my simple iced coffee w/ soy and one pump classic, so that's another bonus. The Barista's were cordial and busy, but isn't that how all Starbucks tend to be?!?\n\nThat flag, it got me!",1,positive
Slowest.  Starbucks.   Ever.  Seriously.  I've gotten more free coffee from this than a support group meeting.  I'd rather pay and get it on time.  I like the employees but maybe speed it up,0,negative
I hate this starbucks. They take FOREVER!!!!!! Who was the genus who designed this drive through? They can't do both at the same time or something. It always takes forever to get anything. The drive through is a bit quicker than getting out but I prefer not to idle and pollute phx more than it already is. So this place sucks balls and I am not going back again! Never had a really bad person but I did not really notice. \nHATE THIS PLACE!!! HATE IT!!!!,0,negative
"This is actually the busiest Charlotte Starbucks by sales (fact) and they do well managing the place considering how busy it usually is. Drinks are always prepared expeditiously and for the most part, all the folks who work there are pretty friendly all the time. The only gripe I have is that drinks can vary based on the barista you get. Basically, some drinks come out better or worse depending who makes it and there should be more consistency in my opinion.",1,positive

"Immediate knockdown of a star for being a chain coffee shop that doesn't offer free wifi.  So there.\n\nI stopped here to avoid a rainstorm that caught me without an umbrella and I thought it would be nice to grab a yoghurt, cappuccino, and get a bit of work done whilst I waited.  Mango yoghurt parfait was too sugary, cappuccino was more like a latte, and work was limited to offline stuff since I'm too cheap to pay the $4 for 30 minutes.  Especially since the rain stopped and I was out of there in 10 anyway.",0,negative
"I try to avoid this location as much as possible, but it's one of the only Starbucks close to my Thursday commute. They service is SLOW.

"This location is my favorite!! Always correct, always fast and they accept the iPhone Starbucks app!! Love it!!",1,positive
Why does this place take so long to do anything? I have never had to wait so long at a Starbucks even during peak hours. This place is always slow wether u go inside or drive thru..I am not coming here anymore. Because beside the wait they have always got my order wrong. The young girls working  inside gossiping should focus on completing orders instead of bs-ing. \nAs of right now I have been in the drive thru line 32 minutes!,0,negative

"Wanted to try a new coffee place on a Saturday and boy I shouldn't have! I waited approx 30 + min for a packaged oatmeal and Chai Tea. It was 10am and they were already out of bagels and crossaints! This is why I had to settle with packaged oatmeal. There were many angry customers waiting as well. Looked like a cool place but definitely will not be returning to. Oh and their Chai was not very good, entire cup was ice leaving little Chai and they charged me more than what was advertised on their menu!",0,negative
"Horrible service every time I come. Id give NO STARS IF I COULD! Order either doesn't get done or they ask for your name and don't call it and someone takes your drink.  Here's a noble concept, some people actually sometimes order the EXACT drink. \n\nMy sandwich was taken by someone who ordered the same thing. Only thing I got was a the obligatory Sorry.

"This has to be the SLOWEST Starbucks I have ever been to. I don't understand it. It doesn't matter the time of day/week -- its slow. If you don't have a good 20 minutes to wait, go elsewhere.

"Still no coffee available if you go through the drive through, AFTER 5 am. Really.\nThese lames will get none of my biz. No coffee ready ??  Lame.\n\nTheres a Rebel Gas Station, and a Del Taco a few blocks west on Charleston - theres always good coffee,  for those that care.",0,negative
"I have had a lot of issues at this location.  They often run out of breakfast items, even early in the morning and my ice tea is always watered down even though I order it with no water added. The staff isn't always friendly as if they really don't want to be there half of the time.  The drive thru is exceedingly slow but the parking is so bad, it is sometimes impossible to park and go in. As much as I love Starbucks, I try to avoid this location whenever possible.",0,negative
"Awesome people, service is fast. They have their days when they get slammed, but the service is as good as you'll get from any starbucks from any busy metro in the US (New York, LA, Chicago).

The coffee here is fantastic and the people are nice. The reason I am giving this place 1 star is because the employees working the window talk to much to the people in th drive thru. I dont want to wait in line for 30 plus minutes and then tell some fucking teenager what I'm doing today. JUST GIVE ME MY FUCKING COFFEE my god!,0,negative
"Coffee is drinkable but the barista totally hate customers and don't know anything about making coffee. If you ask for cream when they are out, they say ok and then go back their conversation they've got going with the same old guy that hangs there all day.

There's not enough room to accommodate the morning line to order.\n\nConsistent like most Starbucks locations are, however not as appealing to those of us who prefer black coffee because they no longer rotate the coffee varietal in the drip.

"I don't like to write negative reviews but this place is so dysfunctional and unorganized.

"Really slow baristas!! Some are standing around !! Maybe they're on break but then, they should hang around where the customers can't see them !!it just looked like a bunch of no good employees ( looks that way) if they're in the same area and it's busy not doing anything",0,negative
"Just went thru the drive-thru with one car in front of me. Watched as 4 employees took a group photo (outside of the building) while we all waited in line.

"Usually every starbucks I have been to has pretty great costumer service, I was so excited about this starbucks opening up since is right in between my work and home. Well I have got to say that this is by far the best Starbucks I have been to, costumer service completely blows my mind here and I love how helpful they are. There is one guy who explained to me the iced coffees and a lot about one of the machines and I was in heaven learning about all of this! For sure one of my favorite spots!",1,positive

Worst Starbucks store in Pittsburgh. There is no management and all of the decent workers end up leaving. I can't get a simple cup of drip coffee without having to wait 5 min in line to order and then another 5 min while the poor idiots figure out how to fill my cup. I'm done!,0,negative

I use to love it here when it first opened and i meet the owner & his wife. But now it is way overcrowded. The coffee taste burnt but is pretty.

By far one of the worst starbucks I've ever been too. I am a barista at Starbucks and this makes us look really bad. Jenny the cashier was super rude. I also asked her how much water was and it was 54 cents(which was tap water too not filtered). C'mon manager you really want people like her working at your location. I know your a franchise but live up to the name dude. \n\nRaul was the only good thing. Nice guy doesn't mind talking to people.,0,negative
Starbucks makes ok everything but this location was very frustrating. We arrived on a busy Saturday evening and there was one person working... and sneezing on everything... every seat was occupied by people who clearly had not ordered in a while and who were set on occupying space for the long term. I'll avoid this location moving forward.,0,negative
"yay, im a fan. Of course it's starbucks, but this one is good. They're quick and pretty friendly. Not overly strange barista types. At night it can be a good place to get some work done as it is decently empty at night. The crowd comes in at lunch and late morning. Early or late enough and you'll have a free spot to get a cup. \n\nI'd tell you what I had, but it's starbucks, if you don't know what to order...it's 2012.",1,positive

The worst Starbucks I've ever been to and it's too bad it's the closest to my home. You can count on your drink leaking ALL over the place and a cup full of ice.

I get they were busy, but you still need to show good customer service. I love my Starbucks and would not have cared about the wait as much if we didn't have to deal with teenage girl attitude.",0,negative
Worst customer service ever. Asked for a LARGE cup of ice and was given a medium. Asked again for a large and got some excuse about inventory and not being able to charge for water.

Shitty service. I went in to buy some coffee in prepackaged bags. Saw a sale price in red right on the package but at the register the girl would not honor. Are you freaking kidding me?!  WTF. False advertisement. Then they were out of bags and asked if I wanted to just put all my coffee just in my purse!?  Thanks for nothing Starbucks on Christmas Eve!!! Never again. They lost me at false advertisement.,0,negative
This location is ridiculous...I need to stop coming here but it is right around the corner from my job. Sometimes I just get my coffee from circle k. The staff is slow & the manager well he is just plain out rude. They often get our order wrong. UGH! so frustrating when you need your morning coffee. Oh they never have the food we want.,0,negative
"obviously I love Starbucks. the food and drink taste good but today the staff was rude, unfriendly and lacked customer service overall. it took 20 minutes to receive my panini (which usually takes 5) other customers were also complaining that their coffee was taking forever. this location is slow, the workers were not doing much and still were not making customers food/drinks. ever heard of a smile, ladies?",0,negative
"The managers at this place are a bunch of ass clowns. Drive thru takes 10 min. ! You have to pull around for a cheeseburger and a coke, and there coffee machine is always getting cleaned at 6:00-7:00am. Hey dumbass, people like coffee in the Morning! Go to the one on Power and Ray. They are dialed in up there.",0,negative
"This Starbucks is pretty slow and unfriendly.  I, like someone else, tried to use a free drink that I had earned but they told me they don't do that.. Hmm however you take my money from my Starbucks card.. \nAt least try to be emphatic about not accepting my free drink reward, don't have an attitude. \nAnyways, if you're craving Starbucks it'll do.",0,negative
"I am a big fan of this drive thru. It is the fastest in town!!  The service is top notch and the people are always happy and fun. Obviously management is very good. Not saying other Starbucks aren't good too, I just am in favor of this location.",1,positive
"I may be friendly but I will probably never be Dutch Brothers Friendly. Evertime I go to this location everyone is always super nice, my coffee is always delicious, and I some how always get sucked into an awesome conversation with the workers. I'll choose Dutch Brothers over any coffee anyday!",1,positive
"Still no coffee available if you go through the drive through, AFTER 5 am. Really.\nThese lames will get none of my biz. No coffee ready ??  Lame.\n\nTheres a Rebel Gas Station, and a Del Taco a few blocks west on Charleston - theres always good coffee,  for those that care.",0,negative
Rude! I work nearby and come ever so often and each and every time that staff has been extremely rude to me. \n\nIt could have easily been my favorite coffee shop in the area (I rather support a local business than a national chain) but at least when I go to a national chain I know i'm usually getting excellent service.,0,negative
The reason I am giving this place two stars because their drive-through is horrible. On several occasions I've waited more than 20 minutes to get my coffee making me very late for work. They don't seem to understand if somebody's order takes a long time to make have them move out-of-the-way. Today is the second day in a row I'm late for work because of their horrible drive through time. I know they're under new management.  They need to step it up,0,negative
"We travel all over the country and hit a Starbucks for our morning shot of Joe. The worst service of any Starbucks I've ever been in is a mile from our new home. Lucky me. I asked to speak to the manager but she doesn't come in until the afternoon. So, in the morning when the place is busiest the manager doesn't work. It shows in their level of service. Drive to another location, it's worth it.",0,negative
"I stop by once a month to remind myself that, although close to my house, this place is still lame, poorly run and the customer service sucks.  If your playing on your phone when I come in, can you please wash your hands before rubbing them all over the lid of my coffee... which is average at best.  Oh and this is a new trend you may want to try, when I hand you my money, you reply by saying Thank You.",0,negative
"WORST Starbucks in Vegas. The drive thru is painfully slow in the mornings. This lady they hired always works the drive thru and is dumb as a sack of bricks. I refuse to visit this location any more! The manager of this store must be blind, or as ignorant as the employees here!",0,negative
"Starbucks is generally 2-3 stars, quality of coffee-wise but, I give this location 4 because they seem to manage heavy volume well in the morning.  The lines move reasonably fast although I am usually just a Venti Bold kind of guy so, not sure how long the wait is when ordering something barista-centric.  This location is WAY faster than the one near BofA so, keep that mind if you are in the area, and in a hurry to get that caffeine jones cured.",1,positive
"Starbucks quality coffees, pastries, and other assorted food/drinks.\n\nFriendly staff that is able to keep it together during crowd rushes.\n\nAnd a heck of a location in the beautiful Omni William Penn Hotel.",1,positive

"I love DD! Their coffee is the best. But this particular location has really gone down in the customer service. There is usually no line and they are consistently rude when ordering and at the window. Whats the deal??? Great coffee, rude people. Thats a bummer.",0,negative
This starbucks doesn't live up to the standard of the starbucks name. Each time I have been there my drink has either been made wrong or poorly. The location doesn't seem to be prepared for their morning rush. I make the extra drive down rural to go to another starbucks to get my coffee.,0,negative
"Worst Starbucks I've even been to. I avoid this place whenever I can. Terrible service, slow drinks and filthy inside! I have complained to the manager, emailed the corp office but seems everyone is fine with this because it never changes. I could tolerate the slowness and even avoid the questionable interior....but I can't excuse rude employees that seem to think they are superior to everyone around them.",0,negative
"i'm never gonna get my head around my fellow AMERICAN's obsession with STARBUCKS. i have friends that are late every month on their VISA and MASTERCARD accounts (which are probably mostly STARBUCKS charges anyway) because they have a forty-plus-dollar a week coffee habit.\n\nstill, when you're on the road, it's nice to have a place where you can drop by and jolt the senses into a heightened state of alertness and use their WI-FI to get caught up on your e-mail.",0,negative
"Good thing is: no line.  But bad thing is it's the dirtiest Starbucks I've ever been in. Floor was filthy, behind the counter and throughout the seating area, trash was everywhere.  Counter was sticky, newspapers strewn everywhere. I've never in my life seen a Starbucks so dirty (and I've been in many).",0,negative
I too should have looked at Yelp. Shitty food but they sell Guinness so they can't be that bad. Shitty food. Don't eat there unless you have had shitty food before,0,negative
"Well I'm really confused as to why Yelp would remove my review, being that's what this is all about.. Let me rephrase..

Never written a review on yelp and this is my first. Absolutely the worst experience I've ever had at an auto establishment. I go to the Fletchers off Lake Pleasant and Happy valley frequently. This is the first time I've gone to this Fletchers. I cannot express to you strongly enough to stay as far away it from this place as you can. Rude inconsiderate and unprofessional.,0,negative

"Although the address is correct,  when you use the directions on the Yelp mobile app you are directed to the AIRPORT, not the restaurant about a half mile down the road off Sunset. The food and salad bar isn't too bad. How many filets and potatoes can you really eat until you feel terribly full.",0,negative
Yelp really needs to add a 0 star. Their food is garbage. I guess it's a good thing their servings are small which is why I did not feel guilty throwing the rest of it away.,0,negative
I don't understand all the hype on yelp. Obviously people on this have not tried good tacos. Not even because I was drunk I thought they were good,0,negative
"I wish Yelp would allow me to give zero stars. I went here to buy flan for one of my patients and was pressed for time to get some lunch. The line for tacos outside was long, so I ended up buying some chicken salad. Something told me it prob wasn't the best idea, but it tasted okay. Two days later I'm still suffering from food poisoning. And the patient I bought the flan for said NEVER eat anything from Mariana's and that she only shops at Cardenas. Sigh.",0,negative
Another Yelp success story!  I've been looking for a neighborhood pizza and wings place and finally found it!  I'm very particular about my wings and happy that they measure up!  The pizza is great too and the antipasto salad is just right.  Add delivery and Bruno's saves me from cooking dinner!,1,positive

"Really glad Yelp is smart enough to filter out the 5 star reviews. If you notice, the exact same people, with the exact same 5 star reviews posted them EVERYWHERE they possibly could. \n\nThis place is quite possibly the biggest joke of a business I have ever encountered. My best friend \""""bought\"""" her dress there.

Guess I will not be writing reviews any longer if my first amendment cannot be heard.\n\nBy the way was not this restaurant in Dirty Dining TV review on channel 5 a few months ago?  I think Yelp should be alerted on this place.\n\nWhere in the h-ll do you get a 4.5* rating review?, Yelp is a farce.",0,negative
Went to studio to take my first class after paying a week ago and the Landlord had a post that they haven't paid rent and locked them out. They are out of business and I am out of money. Yet Yelp has a great offer for you to pay $75 for $100 of worthless classes. Should keep up to date.,0,negative
"Am I forced to give a single star?? Yelp fix this issue first. Coming back to Pizza Hut, this girl working on 7/25/14 @ 8:45 pm was rude and mean to me after I gave them almost $600 business. She says she can't deliver to me being mean and rough and hung up phone on me. Fire her because that's not a good customer service. My business is not going to freaking Pizza Hut anymore just because of her.",0,negative
"I read reviews on Yelp all the time, but it takes something special to cause me to write one.  Green's food absolutely blew me away.  The flavors and combinations are just amazing.  I was in Phoenix on business and ate here 5 times in 3 days.  The sandwiches are the best vegan sandwiches I've ever eaten, and the salads are great too.  Friendly staff and a cool atmosphere top it off.",1,positive
"One month after my unfortunate meal at The Mintt. I have received no response to my complaint about the rude, dismissive treatment or the overly spiced food.

"I like how employees, co workers, and friends of this business are creating yelp accounts and writing how great of a service they get.\nThis all happens after my post. It's all fake, it's all bs, don't believe them.\nThis is exactly the kind of reaction I expect from this place!!",0,negative
"After I posted my Yelp review, I received an email from Juan offering me a refund and asking me to take down my review. I have since been refunded in full and greatly appreciate it.

Very uncomfortable seating in front of the main screen, greasy blah bar food.  Emeril must be hurting for $ if he puts his name on this establishment.  Great place for a guys outing.",0,negative

This Dairy Queen shows me that it can be worth it to check out yelp reviews for large chain restaurants.  I don't like going to Dairy Queen because it's so banal but banal would be an improvement for this Dairy Queen.\n\nIt was dirtier than my men's dorm room back in college (thankfully since I cleaned up my act) and I ended up paying for an expensive orange juice masquerading as an Orange Julius.,0,negative
"I'm briefly breaking my rule about reviewing chains simply because the service at this particular location is always top of the line.

"I felt the need to update my 1st post about KOs. Like I said before I eat there a lot and I like it a lot, so to have given it 3 stars based on 1 bad trip out of many is not fair. \n\nI feel that too many people on Yelp do what I have done. People are creatures of habit and eat at the same place a lot. No body remembers the positive things, and are too fast to comment about a bad experience. \n\nKOs is A OK in my book. I'll be back soon!",1,positive
Yelp deal is a big sham. I did a togo of food on a Tuesday night and the guy at the counter says the manager wont accept it. He agrees after I read him the conditions and fine print from Yelp.  An item in my order was also missing. Food is so-so. There are far better places for Indian food around.,0,negative
"This Panera blocks Yelp! on their in-house WiFi - no joke, check it out yourself.  Pair this issue with the incessant parade of tweens and soccer moms on Saturdays plus a blitzkreig of post-mass zealots on Sundays and I really can't fathom a reason to patronize this location as opposed to the rest.  Sure the coffee is good and the A/C is on full, but save for that you're better off at Boca Park or driving down to Fort Apache.",0,negative
"This is my first to write a review on yelp because I was pissed off when I walked out from this restaurant! Food was over priced, and the taste was so so.

If they want better tips only need to change their attitude instead charging tips that is business. Never go there again!",0,negative

Enjoyed all of this on the outside patio.\nWill come back again.",1,positive
Update: After I wrote my review I was contacted immediately by management and I have to say they could not have been more professional and proactive!

For my negative experience and review I was harassed on Yelp by Duy V. who is obviously associated with B&T Nails in some way as this person recently uploaded photos for the business. That is sad and this person needs to get a life and find something more productive to do other than send me insulting comments that are not true.,0,negative
Our biggest mistake was not checking Yelp reviews before attempting to dine here because the terrible reviews are spot on. The first item to come to the table was a bowl of miso soup and it was black and looked like somebody had dredged the bottom of a swamp to make it. The cucumber salad was a pile of unevenly chopped up cucumbers drenched in soy sauce. The sashimi was clearly not fresh and had been frozen so long it no longer had any flavor. This was by far the worst hotel restaurant food I've ever eaten.,0,negative
"This had been a bad experience all and all, the service was horrible the staff was not friendly (and I bet was talking s$&@ behind our back) the price was not the cheapest and to top it all off my gf did gel which was supposed to last 3 weeks and peeled off after less than 24 hours (see pic).\nThe only good thing about this place is that it's well maintained.\nToo bad, yelp never fails but this time it was a fail!",0,negative

"Not sure about the value of Yelp's rating system....we had a disgusting experience at Gordo's which was factually written....only to have the review removed after a short while.   I would advise anyone to take a close look at this restaurant BEFORE you place an order.  If it looks like a place you want to eat....then it's right for you.  I suspect highly the \""""rave reviews\"""" are written by friends or management.",0,negative
I agree with RJ - the 5 star review and the posted photos appears to be from the restaurants GM per their Facebook page. \nThat's not good Yelp etiquette.,0,negative

"Do not get too excited about the $5 for $10 Yelp coupon.    When you get there and try to pay using this coupon, all of the sudden some things on their menu are not allowed to be purchased using the Yelp deal.  They claim they can get away with this with the wording in the fine print, I looked at the fine print, and disagree.   Always a interesting experience ordering and eating at this place.  Unbelievable.",0,negative
"After a promising response after my previous yelp review, I was pleased to see them reaching out to reconcile the poor service I received at the restaurant.  After 2 months, I have not received the alleged giftcard.  Would have been nice to use that giftcard to give them a second shot, but I guess not.",0,negative

We ended up getting up and walking out so thanks for the free beer! \nOne can change the menu, change the look and the name; but all in all its still a $hitty bar with even worse service.  Go down the road to Rock Bottom or Red Lobster for better service and better food.",0,negative

Really bummed!! Yelp reviews made me want to try everything! We were staying at a nearby hotel and had our shuttle give us a ride to this place to find out they weren't serving food even though the hours posted were until 12:00 am on Saturdays & we arrived at 11:20 pm. Very disappointing!,0,negative
"Dear Chad B. First of all, if you want to use Yelp learn how to use it. None of these bartenders you mentioned work at the Buffalo location. Second, I have lived in Nevada for 27 years and the 2 bartenders you mentioned are two of the best bartenders I have ever had. Your yelp review is false and all locals should ignore it for both the Buffalo location and the girls he mentioned location.",1,positive
I took a friend here thinking maybe she would like it because of the high rating. I thought maybe I just had a average run there (giving it a 3 star rating). The food wasn't anything to return to and the owner didn't really want to honor the free Yelp check in. He said it was an older offer. My friend who is new to Yelp was excited to try it but wasn't blown away like the high star rating claims. I wasn't either. Fool me twice. . . .,0,negative
Any Yelper that gave this place more than 3 stars must either work their or be friends with somebody that works there.  TERRIBLE.,0,negative
"I wish I'd consulted yelp.

Whoo!\""""",0,negative
"I've never posted to Yelp before, but these guys were so good I just felt compelled to share my thoughts. Their prices and courteous service, both huge positives, pale in comparison to the fish tacos and Parmesan/truffle fries. My heavens, those fries!  Thumbs up from me and my 7 and 4 year olds.  I'm following Roaming Fork on Twitter now, but I believe I'll be following them just about everywhere and anywhere else, too\n.",1,positive
"Thank you to Yelp again - we found this great spot so close to the hotel we could walk.  The line was out the door but moved quickly.  The cashier was nice and answered all my questions. Everyone was happy - bloody marys, specialty coffees, great breakfast items.  We will return the next time we are in Tempe.",1,positive
"I don't \""""Yelp\"""" much but this place deserves a good review! We strolled in a few weeks ago after shopping at Nordstrom Rack and enjoyed their happy hour, and then went back the next night for dinner. This is the one Mexican place my husband and I can go to and not feel sick afterwards. Their food is super fresh and the 3 servers we have had on the 3 different times we have visited have all been great -- attentive and welcoming. After living in Chandler for 2 years now, I'm just bummed I didn't find this place sooner!",1,positive

I specifically came on Yelp to find a new nail salon. This place got good reviews so I figured what the heck.. Let's give it a try! I have not been disappointed yet. The workers are very friendly and the owner goes out of her way to accommodate everyone. I have been three times and I will continue to come back,1,positive
This company closed their locations and didn't even update their  page about the closure.  Yelp is an untrusted source because the information of this closure is on the internet yet they still advertise as though it is a viable listing.  shame on yelp!!!!!!!!!,0,negative
"Not a great dining experience. Adequate service, but food is just ok. Definitely didn't love it.",0,negative
"Very good food.  Kitchen still seems to be working it out. Ordered entree with lemon butter sauce and had to ask twice for it to come out. Also asked for side on separate plate as one of us is vegetarian and entree was not. They missed it, which is fine, but the awesome bartenders had to go back twice to get it fixed. Good bar.  Awesome ice glass blackberry cocktail.  Great wine list    \nGood bartenders.  Hopefully they work out a few kinks. We'll go back.  Food overall was very good and priced right.",1,positive
I love the atmosphere on weekends with the DJ. Now when I say DJ I'm talking about good beats playing in the background when your dinning. Not a club atmosphere with dancing going on everywhere. Amazing specialty drinks and the food is very good as well. Nate was our server he did an amazing job. Decor fits what they are trying to accomplish swanky with a bit of lounge atmosphere.  I gave this a five because it had all the elements that I like in a restaurant.,1,positive
"I came here with my fiance's family for dinner and a little casual celebration.  The food was fantastic and the service was good.  The only down side is that the place is a bit noisy, and a little crowded.  People kept bumping into my chair as they passed, and while it's not overly loud, forget about holding a quiet private conversation.\n\nI had one of their specials that day, a shrimp ravioli, which was exceptional, with nice sized pieces of shrimp cut up into the sauce.  The chef seems to really know what he's doing.",1,positive
"Wide range of menu items, great service from hostess and waiter. Nice layout of Resturant and Bar area. BBQ chicken chips as appetizer was amazing. Will def go back to try more items on the menu.",1,positive
"Yes, it is that good!  Pizza was very good the second time though not as spectacular the first visit. I think the kitchen got rushed. But all is forgiven, Everything else is perfect. Love the chop salad. Great beer. Great wine.  Gorgeous date.",1,positive
"Everything was perfect!  There are so many courses and surprises, no one couldn't be pleased.  The food is terrific, and there is something for everyone.   The staff is also terrific, and one can tell these people seem to like what they do.  Make no mistake, this is an expensive restaurant (over 250 per person with tax and tip) but I feel it was sowrth every penny.  Can't wait to go back.",1,positive
"I went here for dinner and it was a huge disappointment. It was mostly fried food and not too much to rave about. The middle eastern section did have a good lamb dish but honestly, I would not go again. They had snow crab legs but nothing except the middle east section was memorable. The whole place had mostly fried food. The desserts were also very mediocre. I should have done a lap around beforehand. You are also in the basement of the hotel, not casino level or up a flight.",0,negative
"the ambience, decor, and the staff are excellent. I've had a couple fine dining experiences and this one was magnificent. I love cooking and I think I can do steak pretty well but what I love about what they offer here is they give me a product I can't make myself and my was it delicious. you're definitely in for a treat",1,positive
"This restaurant was such a let down! It is very trendy but the food is very pricey and the ambiance is terrible! The booths are so close you feel like you are dining with strangers. The interior although bright and playful is like dining in a cafeteria. The staff are impersonal and rush you through your dining experience. Save your money and eat at Vintner's Grill hands down...better food, nicer atmophere!",0,negative
My husband & I have been coming to this Village Inn since 2008. We really enjoyed it. The food there is excellent (I normally eat their breakfast meals) and the service is good. I love the new look they have now. They remodelled the inside of the restaurant since last year. It looks fantastic. I love the new colors too. Great place.,1,positive
"I just had dinner here and it was amazing, the atmosphere was nice and classy, as well as clean. The staff were very friendly. I didn't have to wait too long for the food, the side salad had amazing croutons. I ordered the prime rib, and it was delicious, as were the fries. Would definitely recommend this to a friend.",1,positive
"The location and architecture was beautiful, but the service was severely lacking. Service was quite slow, the queso appetizer was tiny, I received the wrong entree, and it took half an hour to get the check at the end. They seemed to be closing up the restaurant well before the hours stated, and decided to ignore us for most of the evening.\n\nI will give this restaurant another chance, but just for drinks, definitely not for dinner.",0,negative
"Had a travelzoo voucher for this. Had a hard time getting a reservation which is quite odd since it was fairly empty when we went there.

Kinda felt the food was overpriced for what we got.",0,negative
"All of these reviews seem to be hit or miss.  Mine was definitely a \""""miss\"""".  Service was AWFUL, and the hostess was a complete bitch.  And the place was not full.  Food was mediocre, when we finally got a chance to order and eat it.  Wine came very late.\nI was hoping to find a hidden gem but instead discovered a stinking turd.",0,negative
"Overall this place looked nice and has good food. Tables were too close and we felt like you would be dining with all the people at the tables which surrounded everyone so we ate at the bar. Too pushy on the alcohol, not everyone drinks alcohol. Servings were small.  We ate at the bar it was okay, good service but you needed keep on top of the bartender. I would go back and eat again.\n\nThe wine selection was very good. I think a major plus is the menu.",1,positive
"The 5 course tasting did not impress me.\nOverpriced food for bland if not disgusting for one's palliate. \nTold the manager it was our anniversary & the waiter carried out a \""""Happy Birthday\"""" plate...lol\n$200+ (including wine) was doable for a fine dining place, but I wouldn't go back.\nMy fiancee kept saying how claustrophobic it was (which @ 1st I would say \""""it feels intimate\""""), but I finally gave in & had to agree.",0,negative
service was great but the food lacked that mediterranean spice i wanted.  i ordered curry chicken and didn't like it at all.. way way to much rice and 5 very small pieces of chicken.. over priced and the lack of ppl in the establishment made my party feel like we smelled like a cheep las vegas whore.  \nif you like paying a lot for crappy food then by all means check this hole in the wall place out...,0,negative

"Had  lovely birthday dinner here for my wife. The setting was nice although the waiter did hand me a flashlight to read the menu. With booths around the perimeter and four tables in line down the center the size was intimate, but not isolated. Service was excellent and the food was very good and nicely presented. Rating is on the high end of four stars.",1,positive
"Couldn't have asked for a better eating experience!  From the moment we walked in, we were treated like royalty.  Fabulous appetizers, salads and the steaks are unbelievable.

Dough it too stiff. Burata is OK. Fresh mozzarella is too dry. Pumpkin gnocchi were very tasty. Veal Marsala is horrible. Thick slices of low quality veal. This place was great about ten years ago.\n\nDessert: Black and white is very rich and sweet. Half Blondie and half brownie with ice cream. \n\nWIGB? No",0,negative
"The staff was really great. The food, however, was not worth the money. The reviews about the happy hour are right on, this would be a great place to visit for cocktails. The Chilean sea bass was $38, overpriced. The homemade pastas were gummy and the sauces lacked flavor. The Ragu pasta is just that, Ragu you can buy at the grocery store. The cream sauce for the tortellini was the consistency of skim milk. In this economy, dining out with a family of four is a big deal. Tonights dinner was disappointing.",0,negative
Food and ambiance were very good. Nice creative place for vegas style dinner. I would go back.,1,positive
"Amazing. Amazing.  Amazing. Highly recommend it. We had top ranked waiter named Freddie. Manager had that restaurant running at 110%. You can not go wrong here. Food was AMAZING... From wine recommendations, appetizers, mouth watering steaks, to decadent desserts. Unbelievable!!",1,positive
The service was excellent as was the food.  The atmosphere was great as well. I would definitely recommend this place for friends or a couple. My friend and I were on a short timeline and they made sure we got out in time to see our show that we had booked. We definitely appreciated that.,1,positive
Fun food but AWFUL SERVICE our meals took forever to make it to the table and the waitress mite as well been none existent. Definitely not worth the 40min wait to get a table (when there was empty tables everywhere),0,negative
The restaurant was loud - difficult to hear and speak with your guests.  Service was not very good - had to ask multiple times for a beer.  Food was over salted.  Kale chips were atrocious.  But the decor was nice and would probably be a good place for a glass of wine.  We did not try the salads so we can't weigh in but our overall experience was disappointing.,0,negative
The place has a great atmosphere but neither food nor service was up to the mark. It gets 3 just for the place and the place is really good for groups. Dinner portions are only for 3 or 6 people. There is no single serving size for dinner!,0,negative
"The music, ambiance, and vibe are amazing ! Everyone dining is so happy and you can see they are really enjoying their food. My pear endive salad was great and my filet mignon medallion was phenomenal! We were a party if 8 and everyone raved about the food! I have dined here several times and have never been disappointed!",1,positive
"Exceptional  experience,  the staff and decor and quality of the food ( oysters, wedge salad, steak and sides) were top notch. The Bonus was the sunset followed by a beautiful full moon. Pricey but very much worth it. Highly recommended.",1,positive

I would def go again!\n\nOh and the service was really good and the food presentation was good as well!",1,positive
Had a terrible experience- the food was mediocre and the service was terrible.  We ordered cocktails and I asked for Vodka and recieved gin and the same happened for 2 others in our party. One person ordered a burger and it came out undercooked and when she sent it back the waiter threw a fit and then did not bring her another meal. At the end she had to tell him not to charge her for her meal- I had the trout and it was alright but the whole experience overshadowed the food. This was not worth the money.,0,negative
Really good atmosphere and lively environment!! Plus the food was also very great and portion size was enough for only one person. Specially the ribs were really good and the sidings with the ribs made it more tasteful! The steak was also good and tasty! Would definitely go here again!,1,positive
"Great location!   Everyone should dine here at least once- the popovers are amazing!  It was a slow night at the resturant but the service was very good, the manager came by to ask if everything was OK, which is always nice.  I had a filet with mushroom caps on the side- soo good.  I will be back to this hotel and to BLT!",1,positive
"The ambiance the service and the wine were 4 to 5 star. The food was tourist food. VERY unexceptional. The first meal in the UK I've been disappointed in. \n\nHad a scallop aperitif that was \""""okay\"""". Nothing interesting about it. Had a vegetarian risotto that sounded amazing and was totally tasteless. My niece had a cauliflower soup aperitif that was bland and a potato stuffed with crab etc... she said \""""I wouldn't send it back but it was just dull\"""". The food in a word... dull.",0,negative
"I had my doubts. No reason for any of them! Service was casual, and approachable.\nThe food is delivered quickly and the food runners are very nice too. \n\nI recommend that you ask your waiter questions, share with friends and order lots of different items from both kitchens. \n\nExcellent - fun place to go for a fancy-casual meal.",1,positive
The wife and I love to go to this place from time to time. The decor is modern and clean and the food is great. I must admit that we have only ordered a few things off of the menu but they are so good we are scared to venture to much on the menu. The fried chicken and the lamb chops are the gems of this menu. I also had one of their infused vodka martinis the last time we went and it was great. We hear that the brunch is equally amazing. Love this place.,1,positive
"The area is cute and the menu is good. Parking was relatively easy.  The restaurant is pretty small but appeared cute and intimate. With all that said, we ordered take out, which was mediocre and waaaay overpriced for what was given.  It really wasn't very good (cold and mushy).  Pretty disappointed.",0,negative
"The food took too long to be served, the staff was not friendly at all. \nBeans were horrible and the steak could have been better, I was told about this place by a friend of mine, apparently he thought this place would offer our party a good time. Unfortunately this was not the case",0,negative
"The venue is very original with a unique and beautiful interior design. Food is great but not always(i do not recommend the lasagna), portions are really big relative to their prices.",1,positive
Pleasant atmosphere. Food was very well prepared and the staff very attentive. Wasn't expecting the quality this restaurant delivered being located in the museum itself.,1,positive
My only complaint was that it was still very hot inside during our summer visit though air conditioned. Tried their chili relleno. The BEST I've had in 20 years. Our waiter practically read my mind as to the wine choice though it was my first visit. Definitely returning soon!,1,positive
Loved this place.  My friend and I each had a lamb dish-- a self-proclaimed specialty of the house.  My rack of lamb with goat cheese was fantastic-- would not change a thing.  Service was superb (ma\u00eetre d Lorenzo!!) and responsive and wine selection solid.  Just a really top-notch experience all around.,1,positive
"Loved this place!\n\nService was great: friendly and quick. The food was delicious and artfully arranged. Ambiance was trendy.\n\nThe food is a little expensive for a casual night out, and I would not recommend coming here if you want a quiet, intimate date. But otherwise had a great time and will return.",1,positive
Really nice and fun decor. Waiter was great. Gnocchi appetizers was delicious. Had lunch sandwich and it's was very filling. Looking forward to going back!,1,positive
"I'm not much of a foodie, so I'm sure I didn't appreciate this place as much as I could have, but the food was tasty and the main dish portion was large.  A tad expensive for my taste but it was worth it for the atmosphere and delicious food.\n\nMy group had the pork chop, lamb shank, beef cheeks and more and all was very tasty and generous portions.  The chefs choice pintxo's were also very good.  The atmosphere was very tasteful and upscale.\n\nI would return for special occasions.",1,positive
Great place. Went there for an important date and we had a lot of fun. The wait staff was a lot more fun and personable than I've experienced at restaurants of this caliber. Everything was just perfect - we will be back.,1,positive
The atmosphere was a little different from what we expected.  It is much more relaxing and casual than the ones we've been to in L.A.  The waiter was very polite and funny at the same time.  He seemed relieved and excited to serve our table since we were the only under 50 table in the whole restaurant.\n\n*Steaks = very yummy.  cooked to perfection.  \n*Decor = a little on the vintage side\n*Service = wonderful,1,positive
"My boyfriend and I dined here on a groupon.  I would have been unhappy if we paid menu prices, they were high based on the quality and portion size of the food  The biggest disappointment here was the service.  The restaurant was very slow during our visit, many empty tables, yet it took forever to get a refill on a drink and our check once we had finished dining.",0,negative

"I really love this place. We had our company christmas dinner there, and numerous dinners among friends. Each time the food was good and service was prompt.",1,positive
Food was very good especially for where it's located. Decor is very high end and trendy so I was impressed.  We brought our own bottles of wine since we are locals and really enjoyed our meal.,1,positive
"Not bad for a restaurant, especially next to a small zoo in the middle of nowhere.  The good thing is that you could enter it without going in the zoo.  The food is decent, but the menu is so minimal.\n\nThe best part of the restaurant is part of the namesake: the shark tank.  If you seen that James Bond film \""""The Spy Who Loved Me\"""", you are probably familiar with Stromberg's shark tank that he transports enemies and traitors to.  At Tiburon, the sharks are a little bit bigger than dachsunds.",1,positive

Loved this place!  Food presentation rivals any 5-star restaurant. Service was great and friendly.  Food was fresh and flavorful. Decor was hip and modern. Definitely worth a repeat.,1,positive
The atmosphere is great. One of waiters is less than friendly. We realize it's not a steak house but my sister asked for medium rare sirloin it came out medium we'll. we kindly sent it back and the second time it came out well done.The food was not good and I will not be returning.,0,negative
"My sister had her wedding reception here on  Friday night and we could not have asked for a better experience! The staff was excellent and the food was delicious! Brittany, the event coordinator was fabulous and attentive. I recommend this restaurant to anyone looking to hold an event. The staff was AWESOME!!! I will tell everyone I know that this is the best place in town for events! Thanks to all the staff for your help! My sister's wedding reception was PERFECT! -Alex",1,positive
"Nice atmosphere and a cozy little dining room, the food was exactly what we were looking for to satisfy our craving for Caribbean. I thought it was a little on the pricey side, but overall it was a great experience.",1,positive
"Absolutely fabulous. We always sit at the bar with Richard. Service is 5 stars. The house salad is perfect to start, then the mix fried fish apps, always two different pastas. We always try something different when we come. Then the brazino with cruda & the lamb. We always get the gelato and sorbets. The wines are a must with the pairing of each dish. The bar to me is the best table in the house. You never know who you will meet there.",1,positive
Good food as usual! Great price too.\n\nThe seating is a little cramped - the table are on top of each other.,1,positive
"Server was helpful with choosing wine and honored a coupon for us, even though we were a few hours too early to use it (truly appreciated).\n\nWe always enjoy the meat and cheese platter, although our \""""crusty bread bowl\"""" for our salad, was a little less warm and too crusty than it usually is.\nThis is an overall good hang-out place where we can spend hours enjoying wine and food, especially the interestingly shaped \""""Rustica\"""" pizzas.",1,positive
"Food and service was outstanding.  Had the escargot appetizer and filet mingnon for dinner, drinks were great too.  I would recommend this restaurant.",1,positive
AMAZING FOOD!!!!  Little place with a great atmosphere. The service was outstanding never having an empty glass and always having more meet coming around. It seems to be family owned and operated and it's not to busy so they made sure to ask us if we had any special requests. The steaks were so perfect that I regretted going to the salad bar first! Highly recommend this place to anyone that enjoys their meats. Groupon was a great deal!,1,positive
"Went here for a wine tasting / dinner pairing.  The wine and food were OK, but the service was pretty bad. They crammed the wine tasting / dinner pairing participants in a row of tables so close together the servers couldn't get to you. Heaven forbid you lift your arm to eat, you'd being giving the person next to you an elbow to the ribs. Seriously, shoulder to shoulder. Food and wine were what I expected. Not great, but not bad. Would have given more stars if they had thought the seating through.",0,negative
"The food here is pricey, but well worth it. The sides are served family style so you may only need two or three for the whole table. The steaks are perfectly cooked and the cuts of meat are the best of quality.\n\nThis particular location offers a cool area to sit in if you are fortunate enough to be seated there. It is a pod-like structure that is in the middle of the hotel atrium. It feels very cool and adds to the experience.\n\nIf you are looking to go big, this is a great place to do it!",1,positive
"Absolutely great food! It was Delicious, good price, big servings, great view, nice and quite. \n\nMy only complain tho, is the service from the Hostess, they suck! get them off their phones and have them seat people. this place would be a 5 star if it wern't for that.",1,positive
"Ambiance is eye-candy, the food is good, the drinks are quiet lovely and the dessert menu will give you a toothache just by looking at it.   The menu is pricey but not overboard.  I liked my experience and would definitely go back again.",1,positive
"A must know ---- EXPENSIVE\n\nI went here for a work dinner.\n\nThe steak is absolutely amazing, and so are the sides, not a single bad thing I can say about the place.

I even used Yelp to make the reservation. \n\nThe restaurant itself was a little hidden, but not too hard to find.  It's also a little small, but there was more room upstairs.  The food was all really good, and prices were pretty reasonable.  It was a little romantic too, and the chandelier was awesome.",1,positive
"I ate at the bar but the service was great, the employees were friendly and efficient. The decor is what you would expect from a free-standing restaurant but this a suite to the larger shopping complex. The food was tasty and reasonably priced. I love that House / Dance music. :)",1,positive
"In a nutshell this place has great prices with top quality steakhouse food. Let me put it this way if the restaurant was inside of the Wynn and called La Flame' it would be 5 stars and ppl would be raving constantly about it. Staff is laid back and pleasant and even the decor has improved since it was Roberta's, one thing that stayed the same is the great food and choices. Hope they don't change as El Cortez and downtown in general get more \""""hip\""""",1,positive
"I was only here for a networking event in the lovely room downstairs so I can't speak to the usual dining experience but in terms of a private event with passed canapes, the food was wildly hit or miss. The tartare was delicious, but the quiches were not cooked - literally runny raw egg. Gah I have the heebie jeebies again just thinking about it.\n\nBut I do want to come back and try the ceasars!",0,negative
"Great atmosphere. Amazing food. A very cozy and homy energy to the entire dining experience. Definitely worth going to for a fantastic memory.\n\nI stayed to watch some of the food be prepped for the dinner that night, I went for lunch, and the amount of care and attention the chef puts into each step and ingredient is something to be marveled at.",1,positive
"Although our server was very nice, the overall service was inadequate. The staff was not knowledgable about the food, and even after we had an issue and the server offered to get a manager, the manager never  came by. They comped the problem food but couldn't be bothered to stop in and ask what our issue was. Even though I am a local bringing in a guest. \nThe drinks are good, ambiance was nice but overall I would not recommend it.",0,negative
FnB is an experience that is best enjoyed when you leave your comfort zone at the door before entering. \n\nThere's no praise that I can heap on top of the praises that have already been given by others- you will have a memorable meal here for all of the right reasons.,1,positive
"I went to dinner here after my wedding with 30+ people. It was the night of the Mayweather fight so things were crazy at MGM. The service was fantastic, the food was incredible. I couldn't image a more perfect evening for my wedding. The manager Mauricio was friendly and made every effort to make sure my wedding dinner was perfect. I HIGHLY recommend this place for any event or just for a nice dinner for two.",1,positive
"This is a nice little diner with a very interesting assortment of food styles and origins.  The woman who works here, who I assume owns the place, is pleasant and very friendly.  I would definitely go back for any meal and take friends with me.  The combination of classic America and Egyptian food is interesting to say the least, and there's nothing wrong with that.",1,positive
"Ate two meals here, the breakfast buffet and dinner, and was happy with both. The service was a little slow for dinner, but they were all very pleasant and gave us our own little room off the back of the restaurant so we could be loud without bothering people. Drinks were decent for a hotel place but cost a little bit of money. Yeah expense account! :)",1,positive
"I ate here practically seven days straight ... every meal, cocktail and dessert was to perfection ... all good ... wish it was near my home as it could quite easily be my 2nd home ... love!",1,positive
"I loved the ambiance and the outdoor patio at night. Our waitress was super nice too, but honestly, the food wasn't anything special. Everyone raved about this place but my chicken was dry and didn't have much taste. Same with my boyfriend's steak :(",0,negative
"A winner.  Varied, fair-priced, excellent service.  Their wine specials are excellent, too.  (Maybe not too good for an intimate dinner as its just a bit crowded, and on the noisy side.  Not a complaint....and, besides, you can always eat outside!)",1,positive
"I love sitting at the bar, it's a wonderful experience.  The food was delicious and the execution was right on.  I wasn't crazy about every dish, but I was able to appreciate the skill that was involved with everything.  It's a pricey restaurant, but worth a visit.",1,positive
"Everything about this place was nice, the atmosphere, the waiter, the salad, awesome bread, my husbands steak... sadly my steak was well done and dry instead of meium rare like I requested. I could have sent it back but I didn't feel like waiting for another to cook.",1,positive
"Onda's looks like a very small restaurant \nfrom the outside, but once you walk in it turns into a large elegant establishment. The food was delicious starting from the bread all the way through dessert. The wine list is extensive, with 18 pages to chose from. Will definitely eat here again. The staff, food, and wine were all superb!!!",1,positive
Amazing.  Can't believe I'm the first to write a review for this place.  The atmosphere was charming and the food was out of this world.,1,positive
"This place exceeded my expectations. My husband and I wanted to go on a romantic dinner to celebrate our wedding anniversary. We heard about Elements that had incredible  views and amazing food with an top master chef. The services was impeccable, and the food is to die for. They even provided us a dessert on the house to celebrate our anniversary. This restaurant is good for first dates, to celebrate a special occasion or if your looking to have a good time. We look forward to coming back!",1,positive
"Terrific food, ambiance, & service!\nOur company had a meeting here. One dinner was catered (for 100+ people) and the crew did a great job. Food was hot, fresh, and tasty.\nThe next night (an open night on our schedule) six of us went to ENVY for dinner.\nService was fantastic. Food was excellent. Could not have gone better.\nIt's worth going here for a meal even if you're not lodging at the on-site Renaissance hotel.",1,positive
"Vibe: Outdoor patio, Boca Raton, FL golf course\n\nService: Very good\n\nWine List: Expensive\n\nTable Bread: Very good\n\nBathroom: OK\n\nParking: At Marriott hotel\n\nFood: Pizza is not good. Dough it too stiff. Burata is OK. Fresh mozzarella is too dry. Pumpkin gnocchi were very tasty. Veal Marsala is horrible. Thick slices of low quality veal. This place was great about ten years ago.\n\nDessert: Black and white is very rich and sweet. Half Blondie and half brownie with ice cream. \n\nWIGB? No",0,negative
We had a wonderful dinner with great service. The waiter was exceptional and did whatever he could to ensure we had a great dining experience. Plus they had a great selection of wines. Very nice. Highly recommended.,1,positive
"Not impressed by anything at this place unfortunately. The decor is decent, everything else is average or below average including the food and service. Everyone is very nice, just not the best servers around. I will not be visiting this place again unless I hear from a trusted source that everything has changed.",0,negative
Good atmosphere but bad food and service. The $60 Steak I ordered was burned and we had to wait another 30 minutes for a second one. The waiter never apologized for the inconvenience.,0,negative
"The good: \nThe food is pretty good.\nIf you can get a table near the window, the view is great. (good luck here).\n\nThe bad: \nThe wait is 30 minutes for dinner\nThe tables that are not right near the glass don't have the view\nThe prices are fairly high. $18+ for most dishes.",0,negative
"YUM, YUM, YUM ... We spent a very shiny penny here!!\n\nWe had the monkfish and filet mignon and lobster, and wine.  Wonderful staff, great food, pretty much all you can expect from a fine dining place.\n\nDefinitely a very nice place to take your significant other.  Romantic and fun.  A nice place to get dressed up and enjoy a very nice dinner together. =)",1,positive
"Went here for a bachelorette dinner, and it was not great. The service was slow, the waiter wasn't overly helpful and the food was mediocre at best.",0,negative
Really pretty good.  Haven't found outstanding wine there yet......but the food selection was good and the outdoor seating fun.,1,positive
"Review based on wine & appetizer (never had a full meal).  They had great service with a good range of wines, many of which were not available at other merchants.  Having a decent selection to choose from by the glass was also a plus.  Unfortunately with the discount wine places opening up in the West valley, this place couldn't make it.",1,positive
"Great potential!  Plan to return soon.  This newly opened neighborhood gem was buzzing on the night we tried.  While they are working the kinks out, the food was great.   The treated my grandmother and young twins special and worked to meet our unique needs.  While the food was outstanding, a broader wine selection would serve them well.  They were very busy and stopped by often to provide updates on this busy night.",1,positive
"Met some friends here for lunch.  The decor was very unique, but comfortable.  The food was terrific.\n\nOverall, a really nice meal.",1,positive
"This review reflects only the check-in:\nUsually we get a great experience at the Aria, as we come back every year. This year we were greated by a very unpleasant check-in clerk. She was very cold and condescending. Luckily the supervisor (Andy), was as always very pleasant and straightened out an issue we had with our buffet offer.",0,negative
"If you're into family-style seating with strangers, limited menus, not having a drink with your meal, and small portions with large price tags, it's perfect.\n\nI hope to go back when they have their liquor licence; that'll give it at least one more star (depending on how many drinks I have ;)",0,negative
"It was next to our hotel, looked better than what they offered. I have been to better Irish Pubs with better food authentic food selections. It was nice, clean and large restaurant.",0,negative
"The staff was really great. The food, however, was not worth the money. The reviews about the happy hour are right on, this would be a great place to visit for cocktails. The Chilean sea bass was $38, overpriced. The homemade pastas were gummy and the sauces lacked flavor. The Ragu pasta is just that, Ragu you can buy at the grocery store. The cream sauce for the tortellini was the consistency of skim milk. In this economy, dining out with a family of four is a big deal. Tonights dinner was disappointing.",0,negative
"If you want an out-of-this-world dining experience - this is the place!!! The atmosphere is elegant and comfortable done in style! The service is phenomenal! The food is to die for!!! Watch their video via their website before going and eat strategically to get your money's worth....\n\nThis place is expensive - check their web site for current prices. I wouldn't bring small children here and I would recommend at bare minimum, dress jeans and a polo shirt.\n\nA solid 5 stars!!!",1,positive
"Charming atmosphere...good drinks, great dessert but the middle was totally lacking.\n\nI couldn't even take more than 3 bites of the Montilana beef in sherry wine sauce if that's what you call it. It was god awful. I haven't had a bad meal like that in ages.\n\nThe server didn't even bother to ask if I wanted something else. I don't call that good service.\n\nThe mexican con leche cake was good, but I won't be jumping up and down to have dinner there again!",0,negative
"The food is prepared at a very high gastronomic level.  Small place and somewhat intimate with nice ambiance.  Poor layout as there really are no \""""good tables\"""" to be had.  Waitstaff was ok but slow - not up to the level of the food.  Went on our 30th wedding anniversary which we stated on arrival but seemed to be no big deal to them.",1,positive
Wine list was very good. Food was excellent. Service was great. Atmosphere was great.  Will go again. I wold recommend this to anyone.,1,positive
"The cute, \""""off the beaten path\"""" look of the place drew us in.  Expensive drinks, the local watermelon beer was good but I can't credit this place for that, only that they served it.  Snobby waitress hardly answered any of our questions...was she that blond that she forgot we asked?  I can only give the place two stars for it's location and quaintness.  Drinks were okay and service was bad.",0,negative
"Spontaneously deciding to eat here on a business trip turned out FANTASTIC. The resort this place is in, is very beautiful; the service; from when you drive up in the lobby, and thru to the restaurant is welcoming. \nThe bar makes balanced delicious drinks like the Ultimate Margarita,  a must try & If you love a steak sandwich....  the French Dip Sandwich will make your mouth water! \nThe view of the golf course is relaxing & the service was timely. \nI would definitely return &  recommend to others.",1,positive
"One of the worse restaurant ever.  The LADY SERVER had a BAD attitude, never offered the options for the selected dinner plate...she just showed no interest at all in serving us. We had no choice but to stand up and leave. POOR SERVICE from a restaurant of Hard Rock Hotel. If I could give a ZERO or No stars, I would! Very Disappointed!",0,negative
Loved this place!  Food presentation rivals any 5-star restaurant. Service was great and friendly.  Food was fresh and flavorful. Decor was hip and modern. Definitely worth a repeat.,1,positive
One of the worst restaurants I have ever been to.  The view is amazing.  But everything else failed tonight.  We had a larger party and the waiter continued to get every order wrong.  He kept forgetting things.  Then he missed 2 people's order altogether.  They kept promising the meal in a few minutes with no luck. Then they brought out the wrong meals.  \n\nThe waiter was the main issue.  He was never sincere and took forever to apologize.  I would pass until they can get their service levels up.,0,negative
"The customer service was wonderful, and the owner is also very interactive with the customers, and very nice as well. The food is very tasty, and the happy hour wine is even better. I would definitely go here for lunch and maybe even a date. LOL The setting is beautiful. This is going to be my new Go To!!",1,positive
"Very high end buffet. The atmosphere and decorating is absolutely beautiful. It has a large and varied selection of good food.The only negative was the price of $45 for dinner.\n\nExc - Feel, food.\nGood - None\nAve - None\nPoor -  Pricey!\n\n\nWOULD I GO BACK? POSSIBLY, ABSOLUTELY IF I AM COMPED!",1,positive
I thought the food was really good from the house salad to our main course and even the french bread that accompanied everything.  The atmosphere was a little lacking but on a nice day you have the option to sit outside.  Service was prompt and friendly but a lil wonkey on a couple of occassions. I'ld go again,1,positive
"Amazing food, great ambiance, and good service. We sat at the Chef's table/bar and it was a great experience. The best thing we ate, hands down was the calamari! Everything else was great including the recommended cocktail.",1,positive
"Stopped here on a recent trip to NC for a wedding.  I really enjoyed my dinner, which was a noodle dish that included veggies, pineapple, and tofu.  The interior was spacious and attractive.  The server was attentive and the ambiance calm, which is just what we were seeking after a weekend of celebrating.",1,positive
"We loved this place. We ordered like royalty and it showed after we saw the bill, however most of the items were delicious and our server was great. The two carafes of Sangria probably also helped with our opinion of the place. \n\nThis is great social type dinner where everything is shared tapas style. The price can get expensive rather quickly so if you are on a budget you might want to go somewhere else or have a big lunch that day.",1,positive
"A nice japanese dining experience.  Ambiance pleasurable.   Miso cod was nice, fish was fresh.  Carafes of sake are a nice offering, and it comes in a very cool glass carafe.  The chef even came by our table to say hello (which apparently is rare).   It was good overall, although didnt blow me away.  A good alternative if you're staying at the Wynn and have already been to Daniel Boulud and SW.",1,positive
"Received graciously and seated in a large but cozy room.  The waiter was rushed but did his job well and helped with suggestions.  Service was quick but not like they were trying to turn the table.  Food was great, although wine list is limited and mostly expensive - not much below $85.  Overall a super experience.",1,positive
Nice place to dine but the food was not tasty at all. Good service. The brunch isn't bad but def has room for lots of progress.,0,negative
"Nice and cozy and old looking setting. Great place for a friendly gathering or taking a foody date. really like the small outside setting, if you can secure one.\nI loved the wine and menu presentation. Good and interesting beer selection and very friendly staff. \nThe menu is full of complex and complicated dishes but try anything and you are in for a surprise. Most dishes are on the heavy side so feel free to share.",1,positive
"Amazing!\nPhenomenal customer service!\nInformative team of waiters!\nAttention to detail was excellent (i.e. drinks filled immediately and empty plates removed quickly)\nLarge bar with separate quiet restaurant attached good for a perfect night out =]\nDefinately will go back I have nothing bad to say about this place and its perfect location, setup, and service! Highly recommended!!!!!",1,positive
"First off, I really liked this place!\n\nI was in town for the weekend, and my wife and I wanted a place to grab a bite for dinner.  Thanks to Yelp, I decided to drop in and check it out. I even used Yelp to make the reservation. \n\nThe restaurant itself was a little hidden, but not too hard to find.  It's also a little small, but there was more room upstairs.  The food was all really good, and prices were pretty reasonable.  It was a little romantic too, and the chandelier was awesome.",1,positive

FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nService was outstanding! Great ambiance! Fantastic views! Very chic/retro and approachable! Great Wine List! WOW! The food was so outstanding that we cannot wait to get back there! Staff was very attentive without being invasive!,1,positive
Food was wonderful - service was great!!!  Large portions - sides were enough for 2.  Had reservations & was seated immediately..  Pear martini was delicious.  Another treat on the menu was Monkey Bread for desert.... Food was pricey but worth the experience....,1,positive
We had dinner there and it was good. It was a bit pricey and the portions small but it was a nice dinner and we got great service. We had a great time.I would return but I would order more food. We underestimated how much we would eat and then drank too much!,1,positive
"I went with a group of people for a Birthday. Fantastic Service, Fabulous food everyone loved their food from lasagna, meatball, chicken alfredo, pasta...Piano Player was great & the magician who came to the table was Awesome! Highly recommend for a fun dinner experience..",1,positive
"Great place to eat, we had a party of 7, and had a 40 minute wait for a table. It was worth it, a bit on the noisy end but the food was excellent and so was the service!",1,positive
Beautiful atmosphere..wonderful service...its an experience.. \nwe had to wait 30 minutes later than our reservation and the dinner took 2 hours..but the dinner was delicious and its a beautiful place. We walked out to the balcony and it's quite a view.\n\nOur server was very polite and sweet. I liked the big table and the service. Our fondue and bread was delicious. I enjoyed the overall experience.,1,positive
"Excellent food,  large variety and great service.   Lobster broiled and.sweetened to perfection.  \nThe molten choc filled cake was an awesome end to dinner.  Expensive,  but to be expected for having great seafood in middle of desert. There were two waiters for my family of 4 and the service was impeccable.  \n\nVery expensive, but if you want to eat something special, be treated special, and for special occasions, this is the place.",1,positive
"Wide range of menu items, great service from hostess and waiter. Nice layout of Resturant and Bar area. BBQ chicken chips as appetizer was amazing. Will def go back to try more items on the menu.",1,positive
"Excellent ambience, great service all around, good portions, beautiful food and great prices. Hands down an excellent place for dinner with friends, family or on a date. My husband and I ordered a variety of foods to taste more dishes and were impressed by them all. We ate 2 entrees, soup, appetizer and 2 beers for $60. \n\nEnjoy",1,positive
The food was overpriced.  If you go on gift cards from one of the time shares chech your bill carefully. They charge u 18 percent tip and the house keeps part of it in other words they make u pay for the gift cards. They do not give it to the waiter and then they ask for more tip for the waiter. Also they have a 2 for $50 dollar menu u will not be allowed to order from so basically the gift cards are worthless there.  Very disappointed,0,negative
"Horrible experience!! Service is slow and food is not properly cooked. I order fetuccini pasta with steak and they overcooked the meat and brought it cold. This restaurant does not provide fine dining, I do not recommend this restsurant to anyone.",0,negative
"The ambiance is very nice, it does have a good location but the food is not all that. My Salmon was on the dry side, the Arugula salad had no flavor, they just put cheese on it and the pork ribs were ok but not the greatest. It wouldnt be my first or second pick if where to eat again. Sorry guys! But the waitresses were very sweet n nice!",0,negative
"We only stopped here for drinks, but its lovely inside for an authentic south african atmostphere. The wine that we had was not to be questioned and the staff were new but service we fabby!! The food menu looked great for all those hardy meat eaters out there!!\n\nIts on my to do list !!",1,positive
"I wish I had a place like this where I lived. Good simple foods, nice service, and not to upscale but classy enough to have atmosphere. I have never had a bad meal here, and the drinks are fantastic! The tile work in the place is really nice, and be sure to try their Foie Gras! Outstanding! Everyone we have sent here has loved it!",1,positive
"The service was fine but nothing over the top. The food was not fine. In fact it wasn't even good. I would not recommend this place to anyone, even if the price wasn't astronomical. \n\nI created a yelp account just to review this restaurant and tell people how awful it is. They try to be  a fancy buffet but the food was just not good. Do not go here.",0,negative
"Went here on a date, overall very nice atmosphere. Politely greeted by manager and staff when entering restaurant. We were seated  in a quaint spot towards the back of the restaurant near the kitchen.\n\nOur waiter was extremely knowledgeable about the menu also very attentive to refilling drinks and checking on us during the meal.\n\nWill visit again!",1,positive
"Overall dining experience was good. Service, even though we chose an outdoor table, was terrific. Food was good not great. Marinara sauce was thin and bland. Veal parm was overcooked and the accompanying pasta was way too al dente. Will likely give it another try because the staff was so nice. In the meantime I am heading back to Portofinos.",0,negative
"Service was top notch, and setting was even better.   I have no complaints.  Bring lots of money, though, in fact if you are even thinking of trying not to spend too much, this is not the place.  \n\nWish I could afford to dine here regularly.",1,positive
"Absolutely wonderful experience. Everything about this place really exceeded my expectations. \n\nThe ambiance, the food, the service, the staff. \n\nAll the waiters seem to know the menu upside down (which is extremely important). They make wonderful recommendations and are very friendly. \n\nI recommend the Yellowtail Sashimi as an appetizer, the salmon crunchy roll, and the horchata flan. We had a few other things, but everything is seasonal so they might not be on the menu. \n\nOverall, great restaurant.",1,positive
"Service is great, food is very good, they keep bringing appetizers so keep that in mind when you go to order on trays . Very good wine list., very nice experience did not feel rushed at all very good service",1,positive
"Simply AMAZING! When looking for a great meal and cozy atmosphere this is the place to eat. A bit pricey but worth every penny! Every course seemed to top the last. Must try the Seafood Platter, Ribeye and Truffle Butter Gnocchies. And oh my, the deserts ... had the privilege to try them all. Each one was absolutely sensational. Only down side is you'll needed to be wheeled out because it's too hard say enough.",1,positive
"Probably my favorite steakhouse next to Ruth's Chris, very similar in taste to it and Fleming's.  Make sure you have them turn on the James Bond table for you.  Bread is excellent.  Had the lemon cake, it was good, not amazing like some people here think.  It's gigantic though, probably can feed 4+ people, was way too much for two.  Staff is very friendly.",1,positive
"Food: really good! Onion rings, burger, s'mores shake!! Pricey!\n\nService: great!\n\nAtmosphere: looks great, but I hate being sat in the half booth right next to another table. Too close for comfort!\n\nTotally recommend. Get a reservation on open table. Cool place. We will definitely go back!",1,positive
"Relaxing atmosphere, friendly staff, beautiful location with outdoor seating, great beers on tap, food was yummy, everything cooked just right, overall a great dining experience.",1,positive
"I'm glad Groupon exists. Thanks to Groupon my girlfriend and I were able and motivated to try this place out. Extremely elegant and modern decor. The upstairs and downstairs cater to different clientele. I doubt you'd go wrong dining on either level. If you are able to, eat here. Take the time and money to dine here. You will not regret it. The food was delicious and the entire dining experience was crisp and amazingly enjoyable.",1,positive
"I can't even remeber what I had for lunch the two times I went 4 years ago. What I do remember was that the property and restaurant was beautiful. I loved the classic relaxed ambiance they created. I must've loved the food because I wouldn't have gone back so quickly, especially to a pricier restaurant on a college budget. I'm sure the ambiance hasn't changed. I need to revisit so I can give an updated review about the food.",1,positive
"We had breakfast before going on the boat tour of the Lake.  The Chicken Fried steak was really very good.  The eggs were cooked perfectly.  Service was prompt and friendly.  This is a very rustic location, very nautical as is appropriate for its location.  If you are looking for Michelin stars, this is not your kind of place, but for good food, excellent service at very reasonable prices, you won't be disappointed.",1,positive
"AH-MAZING!!!!  Was here for my bff's wedding and she had the ceremony and reception there.  Loved every single minute of it!\n\nService - they bend over backwards to help you with anything\nFood - Top notch stuff - highlights was the mushroom puff pastry appetizer, cheese puff, beurre blanc sauce, steak with carmelized onion..\n\nDef. give this a chance, you won't be disappointed.",1,positive
"The area is cute and the menu is good. Parking was relatively easy.  The restaurant is pretty small but appeared cute and intimate. With all that said, we ordered take out, which was mediocre and waaaay overpriced for what was given.  It really wasn't very good (cold and mushy).  Pretty disappointed.",0,negative
"A huge disappointment. Way over priced, with the very small portions. Ambiance and the drink list are OK. However, can not make up for the price. Yelp reviews are over selling the place.",0,negative

"I had the veal flank steak here and it is one of the best I've ever had. Got recommended to come here and it was worth it.\n\nFood: 4/5, juicy veal with great sauce. The duck confit was very good as well.\n\nService: 3.5/5, a little slow but very nice stuff that is attentive\n\nAmbience: 4/5, cool decor and very fun atmosphere for dinner.\n\nPrice: 3/5, a little pricy $30/person",1,positive
"Ambiance and atmosphere was fantastic.  However, the food was below sub par.  Our portebello mushroom appetizer was nothing to write home about and my boyfriend described his stuffed chicken and risotto to taste like \""""lemon pledge\"""".   I had the halibut which was definately not fresh fish and awefully bland and the sauce seemed starchy and blah.   For what we paid it didn't seem worth it.",0,negative
"Liked it.  Good central location and walking distance from the Hard Rock Hotel.\nThe food was very tasty and the food items for your selection are numerous.  That said make sure that you know what kind of sauces to use since it can make the whole difference.  There's is a sign on top of the sauces with recommendations so pay attention.  I followed the post \""""popular\"""" choice which was great but a bit on the salty side.  The dinner is all you can eat while the lunch is not.  Nice interior.  Will go back",1,positive
Beautiful venue and felt very fine dining! Staff was super courteous and informed about menu. Full vegetarian menu which was outstanding! Would go again on next trip!,1,positive
Very good food excellent service planning on coming back. Great place for both men and woman a feminine side with chandeliers and sports shows for the guysThey also have live music at 8 pm and go on Groupon for fantastic deals 20.00 dollars 2 entr\u00e9e s and an appetizer. Easy parking. Our waitress Tracy was friendly competent knowledgeable knew how to use the Groupon deal,1,positive
"I have been here once, I have not one thing to complain about! The food was delicious, hot, and cooked well. Servers were so friendly, and willing to explain everything on the menu. everything is so over priced, but the atmosphere and amazing, its inside the Aria Hotel, cant complain would go back!",1,positive
A good choice for a special occasion. The food is always good here but I just can't quite give it 5 stars because I expect more when I am paying more. The inside is quite nice decor wise.,1,positive

"Great food! Great Service!  I was with three others and we had a fantastic time.  We all did the 115.00 dollar dinner where the chef or server chooses your appetizers, sides and deserts, you chosse your meat.   Everything was exceptionally prepared.  Drinks were also very well made and the deserts (monkey bread, soufle, gelato, cheesecake, etc) were great.",1,positive
"Overall this place looked nice and has good food. Tables were too close and we felt like you would be dining with all the people at the tables which surrounded everyone so we ate at the bar. Too pushy on the alcohol, not everyone drinks alcohol. Servings were small.  We ate at the bar it was okay, good service but you needed keep on top of the bartender. I would go back and eat again.\n\nThe wine selection was very good. I think a major plus is the menu.",1,positive
I thought the food was really good from the house salad to our main course and even the french bread that accompanied everything.  The atmosphere was a little lacking but on a nice day you have the option to sit outside.  Service was prompt and friendly but a lil wonkey on a couple of occassions. I'ld go again,1,positive
"Descent food, nothing special. I didn't like the fact they use part of their dining area toward the restroom as storage. Everything was alright but the fact that the waiter didn't come back and check on me if I needed anything else. As it turned out, I did. Some hot sauce, didn't feel like getting up from eating so I ate without.",0,negative
"I'm not much of a foodie, so I'm sure I didn't appreciate this place as much as I could have, but the food was tasty and the main dish portion was large.  A tad expensive for my taste but it was worth it for the atmosphere and delicious food.\n\nMy group had the pork chop, lamb shank, beef cheeks and more and all was very tasty and generous portions.  The chefs choice pintxo's were also very good.  The atmosphere was very tasteful and upscale.\n\nI would return for special occasions.",1,positive
"We had a party of six who went for a birthday celebration.  Awesome drinks, awesome service, awesome food!  The prime rib was as good as the reviews said it was, the blue burger (made with prime rib) was so juicy the bread did get a little soggy but oh so delicious, the prime rib sandwich was amazing and the au jus was delicious.   I would definitely recommend this restaurant.",1,positive
"I took my wife here for our anniversary last year. The service was outstanding (I think we had three waiters just for our table) and the food was excellent. I had the sea bass and she had the pork chops, both were cooked perfectly and tasted wonderful. For desert they had root beer ice cream and I swear it felt like it was carbonated. The decor was OK but they could do a little more.",1,positive
"Food was good with very generous portions.  1 meal is enough to split for 2 people. The atmosphere was meh, but our waiter was outstanding.  Not only did he continuously check on us, but the others were stopping by consistently to fill out drinks and clear our tables.  Highly recommended if you are looking to get stuffed for cheap.",1,positive
Great atmosphere. Waiters are very into their menus. I really enjoyed the Pork Poterhouse. Wife was less enthused with the quail. Good trendy place.,1,positive
"Amazing food, great ambiance, and good service. We sat at the Chef's table/bar and it was a great experience. The best thing we ate, hands down was the calamari! Everything else was great including the recommended cocktail.",1,positive
"Great food, beautiful setting.  The service was truly the standout here though.  Our waiters were engaging, funny and attentive.  Our sommelier was excellent and helped us choose excellent wine pairings too.  Walk around Aria and look at beautiful people as well.",1,positive
"Yes, it is that good!  Pizza was very good the second time though not as spectacular the first visit. I think the kitchen got rushed. But all is forgiven, Everything else is perfect. Love the chop salad. Great beer. Great wine.  Gorgeous date.",1,positive
"I actually have never ate inside but i have had the food! we used them as a caterer many times before i recommend them for both! food is excellent and staff is awesome! only cigar bar around this area, crowd is decent, business-casual.. they do have valet!",1,positive
"Fantastic food and great decor and music.  It's new so I understand there's a breaking in period, but our service was great anyway so not sure what everyone else is writing about.  Paired with a great wine list and it's a high recommendation from me.  Sunday brunch is a great intro to the place and then I came back with clients for dinner, which was less of a party and more elegant/fine dining for a business mtg.",1,positive
"Food was very good. The waiter warned us about \""""European\"""" sized portions...and suggested that we order appetizer/salad and entree....which I thought was a little weird...but not offensive. (Like we'd never been in an upscale restaurant before)  Service was good without being fussy.  Wine was reasonably priced....with a great deal on bottles.  Didn't have dessert, but it looked tempting. We will definitely go back.",1,positive
"my friend had her wedding dinner here, we all got to pick what we wanted from the menu i was so excited for that i got the petite filet  it was good, \n\nthis place is downtown seemed to be a good area where u can walke from place to place which is awesome not  needing a taxi in this town,this place seemed a bit old but it had a good feel,the service was great !\n\neveryone seemed to like there food i would def go back !!",1,positive
"The food, decor and the service were absolutely great! Their bread cart and the sweet treat cart were great additions to an amazing experience. I didn't try the 16 course because I didn't want to miss out on the carts. The langoustine ravioli and the caviar were the my two most favorite dishes. And if you are a foi gras fan, you must try theirs!",1,positive
The food was good! I had the prime rib special with mash potatoes and pretty legit! The mash potatoes were made from real potatoes and not some box! Only 4 stars bc the waiter was not too attentive I wanted water for the longest time! Overall good good and okay service but we did get seated right away! On the plus side there's also TVs to watch the games! Place looked cleaned and it was an enjoyable meal,1,positive
Nice restaurant with a awesome view. Steak was cooked perfect and service was very good. Very pricey but we knew that ahead of time.,1,positive
"YUM, YUM, YUM ... We spent a very shiny penny here!!\n\nWe had the monkfish and filet mignon and lobster, and wine.  Wonderful staff, great food, pretty much all you can expect from a fine dining place.\n\nDefinitely a very nice place to take your significant other.  Romantic and fun.  A nice place to get dressed up and enjoy a very nice dinner together. =)",1,positive
Great atmosphere...Food and service was top notch. Great place to enjoy an anniversary or special event. Patio was great right by a fireplace.  Portions were huge and meal was cooked to perfection.,1,positive
Good food all around. I had the filet mignon in a foie gras and mushroom reduction. Made it more special that foie gras is banned in California. The service was up to standard. Worth noting that the restaurant has parking in the back. Take the second driveway as the first driveway is a paid lot for the movie theaters.,1,positive
"I really love this place. We had our company christmas dinner there, and numerous dinners among friends. Each time the food was good and service was prompt.",1,positive
Beautiful views.  Nice menu.  Had lunch on patio.  Loved that it was not crowded with a hundred tables crammed in.  Could enjoy the desert and conversations with friends.  I'll go again.,1,positive
"The service was fine but nothing over the top. The food was not fine. In fact it wasn't even good. I would not recommend this place to anyone, even if the price wasn't astronomical. \n\nI created a yelp account just to review this restaurant and tell people how awful it is. They try to be  a fancy buffet but the food was just not good. Do not go here.",0,negative
"If you're into family-style seating with strangers, limited menus, not having a drink with your meal, and small portions with large price tags, it's perfect.\n\nI hope to go back when they have their liquor licence; that'll give it at least one more star (depending on how many drinks I have ;)",0,negative
"I made a reservation here to celebrate a one year anniversary with my girlfriend.  We arrived to our table with a signed card from the staff which was a nice touch.  Our server was prompt and cordial, and the food was fantastic.  I went with the bacon wrapped pork tenderloin and my girl got a filet.  Both were cooked perfectly.  They even offered us a free desert of our choice.\n\nOverall it was great service and great food.  No draft beers which was a bummer, but still a decent selection of bottled beers.",1,positive
I've taken customers here and its definitely a favorite of ours when we feel like eating upscale.  Its got a nice cozy dining area with TVs and nice dimly lit area.  I'm always struck by the smell of the wood burning grill as soon as I walk in the restaurant and that must be my favorite thing.,1,positive
What a great unique place! Great atmosphere! It's as authentic as it gets! After living in Ireland and traveling around Europe this has a divine find. English food is good..don't believe me try this place! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the service is OK at best.,1,positive
It was our first visit to Cains and we were very pleased. Food was very good and reasonably priced. We will be back if ever in Dormont,1,positive
"On one of our infamous outings, my friends and I decided to see what this place had to offer.  The desserts themselves were really good, perfect to quiet a sweet tooth.  But the service left something to be desired.  The waiters seemed more interested in talking amongst themselves than anything else.  Sure there weren't very many people in there at the time, but really.  I think if they raised the bar on the service a bit, this would be a really nice place.",0,negative
"No higher than two stars. Service friendly. Food expensive, yet very basic. No wow factor here. Chart House a better choice. Medium crowd, yet they put us right at tables next to one another limiting privacy.",0,negative
"We came here once for the Mothers Day brunch and were really, really wowed by the indescribably delicious food and impeccable service. Everything -- every single detail was flawless.  The prime rib and the lobster eggs benedict just sent us swooning, and that was before we hit the desserts.  Fabulous restaurant, and I'm hoping my sons will take me there again.  It's awfully pricey for their wallets, so maybe not.  But if your budget allows it, this is one terrific place to dine.",1,positive
Had a terrible experience- the food was mediocre and the service was terrible.  We ordered cocktails and I asked for Vodka and recieved gin and the same happened for 2 others in our party. One person ordered a burger and it came out undercooked and when she sent it back the waiter threw a fit and then did not bring her another meal. At the end she had to tell him not to charge her for her meal- I had the trout and it was alright but the whole experience overshadowed the food. This was not worth the money.,0,negative
Food and service top notch. We had the calamari and scallop appetizer. Shared a dinner salad and both had tenderloin. It was perfect. A little pricey and the wine list was awfully pricey but the food was amazing. Atmosphere was very nice. They do clear out early. It was 10pm on a Friday night and the place was empty.,1,positive
"Pretty darn tasty. Walked in on a whim after a busy night shopping on Walnut and enjoyed the food immensely. It's a noisy and busy atmosphere but that was fine since it was fun to talk a bit to our neighbors. \n\nJust don't expect a romantic, quiet evening to yourself.",1,positive
"This place exceeded my expectations. My husband and I wanted to go on a romantic dinner to celebrate our wedding anniversary. We heard about Elements that had incredible  views and amazing food with an top master chef. The services was impeccable, and the food is to die for. They even provided us a dessert on the house to celebrate our anniversary. This restaurant is good for first dates, to celebrate a special occasion or if your looking to have a good time. We look forward to coming back!",1,positive
"Not a lot of flavor to the food. I got the lobster bisque and it tasted like tap water, Caesar salad wasn't impressive. My husbands prime rib was good but I was just expecting the food quality to be higher in such a nice resort. Service was adequate, no complaints.",0,negative
The place has a great atmosphere but neither food nor service was up to the mark. It gets 3 just for the place and the place is really good for groups. Dinner portions are only for 3 or 6 people. There is no single serving size for dinner!,0,negative
"Excellent service, friendly atmosphere from Hostess to the entire staff! Server was a 10; food was excellent; menu was good; the restaurant decor was theme appropriate and pleasant-very nice. Next time I would try the well designed patio. I recommend tasting their wines. Paul R.",1,positive
It was an ok experience. The food was good and having to cook it yourself was fun for a family. Was it the best food I have ever had? no. The building is quite old and it seemed very dark in there. The floor was sticky and the table also was sticky. I guess I am not in a huge hurry to go back.,0,negative
"After watching Anthony Bourdain I drove 5 & 1/2 hours just to eat here. I surpassed all my expectations . The owner Martin was a nice and took time to chat with us.  The foie gras, the tort with boudin noir, the buffalo steak and the wine list is over the top.",1,positive
"EXCELLENT.  Went there for Mother's Day and everyone was very pleased.  All the dished were fresh and delicious.  Service was also great.  The wine selection was good.  Don't know what else to say, it was great.  We ate on the patio and there was one smoker who appeared to be walking to the pool nearby that was bad for ambiance so, recommend eating inside.  Besides it's cooler inside.",1,positive
"Met some friends here for lunch.  The decor was very unique, but comfortable.  The food was terrific.\n\nOverall, a really nice meal.",1,positive
"So far, I'm impressed.  It was a little pricey for what we got, but it didn't disappoint.  I got the Filet and my wife got a salad.  Both were very good and the wine menu was excellent.  For the money, we probably could have done something else but it's in the neighborhood and we really enjoyed something different.  From the pics on Yelp, I will probably be sampling some new stuff soon.  \n\nI recommend the porch!  It was a great night with a nice light breeze.  Very casual and relaxing.",1,positive
"First rate restaurant.  Went with a large party, and they were very accomodating, even relocating their outdoor heaters to make some of the women in our party more comfortable, as we were sitting out on the patio, and it got a bit cool.  \n\nThe staff is first rate, the food is excellent, the ambiance is definitely upper scale.\n\nWent back a second time, with simply my wife, and the experience was much the same.  Definitely high on my list.",1,positive
"Excellent food,  large variety and great service.   Lobster broiled and.sweetened to perfection.  \nThe molten choc filled cake was an awesome end to dinner.  Expensive,  but to be expected for having great seafood in middle of desert. There were two waiters for my family of 4 and the service was impeccable.  \n\nVery expensive, but if you want to eat something special, be treated special, and for special occasions, this is the place.",1,positive
"OK, if I could eat here regularly, I would. I was super impressed with the service, selection and quality of the food. I made a reservation on Open Table and they were ready for us when we arrived. Sipped on some prosecco and started with the tomato mozzarella salad, which was out of this world. I then had the gnocchi and literally licked my plate clean. My dining companions also had a great experience and I think Wolfgang has something going here.",1,positive
"Unreal!!! Excellent quality food as far as you can see...Crab,oyster,shrimp,prime rib, ham, turkey,sushi blah, blah -it never ends and it's all wonderful. The room is so beautiful and the servers are good. However $17 for a small glass of wine was ridiculous.",1,positive
"A must know ---- EXPENSIVE\n\nI went here for a work dinner.\n\nThe steak is absolutely amazing, and so are the sides, not a single bad thing I can say about the place.  A nice place for a celebration.\n\nVery dim/dark (waitress hands out a small flashlight if required to read the menu)\n\nVery noisy as its connected to a bar with live music",1,positive
"Last time I went to the Joel Robuchon next door, so I decided to try this one.  I was very disappointed.  The service was poor (they also took our forks before we finished our food, and took a very long time to bring them back).  The food wasn't that impressive either, I thought it was pretty ordinary.  The seating was definitely not comfortable for a nice restaurant like this.  I don't think this restaurant has a Michelin one star's quality.",0,negative
"I came here with a Groupon for wine tasting and the wines and food was amazing. The service,  however,  was slow and I had to keep getting up to request my own wine. Server was nice and knowledgeable about the wine, but was forgetful and SLOW! Took 2 hours to get me all of my wines and food. ....",0,negative
"The best dining experience in a long time. It's more like the Jungle Cruise but with food.  Great service. Great (right at your table) chef. And we got out if there spending less  than we planned. I forgot that its kid friendly too. If you've never tried it, I highly recommend it",1,positive
What a JOKE! The valet was incredibly rude to my friends and I. The interior is dated with zero ambiance. Looking for a good steakhouse? Try Tender at the Luxor.,0,negative
"Excellent Food, Excellent Sevice even with 11 people in our party. Lovely place for breakfast.",1,positive
"The atmosphere is nice with romantic lighting and live music. Service is helpful and considerate. But the food is mediocre at best: the short rib is as dry as beef jerky, sea bass is dry and flavorless as well. And the price is much higher than we expected(3 $ on yelp) - we ended up paying 160 for two entrees and an appetizer plus a glass of champaign. Would not recommend.",0,negative
"As for the Bubble Teas-there is no place better! And trust me, I've been trying to find places all over the US-but, no one can beat Rose Tea!\n\nAs for the food-everything we've tried we love. Good portions. Good spices. Good selections. Authentic!\n\nI am there A LOT!! I see many familiar faces when I'm there-and that says a lot for a restaurant. Everyone I've taken there for the first time loves it too!",1,positive
"Personally I've had some of my bestest meals here and they have/had this awesome table wine that was cheap yet probably the best pinot gris ever.  Despite it being a smallish establishment, I found it to be warm and welcome, tasty all around.\r\n\r\nTimes visited: 1",1,positive
"What a great experience.  I have been there 2 or 3 times, and had an excellent meal and a great evening every time.  Exceptionally good staff, very knowledgeable, welcoming, polite and professional.  Excellent menu.  Very attractive decor.",1,positive
"Excellent dining experience. Very random that the restaurant is located in the gift shop of a salon, but once you take a bite of the food you really don't even notice or care. The Chef cooks in an open kitchen which I love and the server was great. My bf ordered the 5 courses and I ordered 4. It was perfect for the two of us. We split everything so got to try a good majority of the menu. We loved it all! Definitely check it out soon!",1,positive
"Really good food and excellent service.  We did not find the chef's tasting menu bland but we are not heavy salt/processed food consumers...\nIt was not overly crowded and we enjoyed a nice, romantic dinner seated in a booth that resembled a big half dome.\n\nCheck out the restrooms adjacent to the bar behind the restaurant...pretty cool view from the \""""throne.\"""" lol.",1,positive
"I went here for dinner and it was a huge disappointment. It was mostly fried food and not too much to rave about. The middle eastern section did have a good lamb dish but honestly, I would not go again. They had snow crab legs but nothing except the middle east section was memorable. The whole place had mostly fried food. The desserts were also very mediocre. I should have done a lap around beforehand. You are also in the basement of the hotel, not casino level or up a flight.",0,negative
"Service and food are superb. The view, what else, amazing!! Your on the 64th floor at TheHotel. My glass was never under a 1/2\"""" from full. This place is amazing. Definitely going back.",1,positive
"Great view and nice environment, but food is ready overrated. The food was at best mediocre..we ordered a pizza to share which was okay... And pasta that wasn't  very good at all...",0,negative
"The cute, \""""off the beaten path\"""" look of the place drew us in.  Expensive drinks, the local watermelon beer was good but I can't credit this place for that, only that they served it.  Snobby waitress hardly answered any of our questions...was she that blond that she forgot we asked?  I can only give the place two stars for it's location and quaintness.  Drinks were okay and service was bad.",0,negative
Okay...we tried Bratalian for the first time last night. The service from Walter was quite slow as it appeared he was the host and waiter. We split a salad and had Lasagna and Veal Saltimbocca for entrees. I found the food edible but not memorable like it is at Rao's. The Moretti beer and cannoli for dessert were probably the highlights of our dining experience. There is allot of competition just within a few mile radius so I am not sure how this restaurant will fare at their price point.,0,negative
"Elegant, cozy atmosphere.  Attentive and friendly service.  We had the two-course fixed price meal.  Great flavors throughout.  A bit pricey overall, but it was a very nice dinner.  Easy location a short walk from the castle and other sights, across from St. Giles church.",1,positive
Not a good experience. Overcooked filet mignon which we sent back and got exactly the same again. Just gave up and ate it. Got some completely uneccesary sarcasm and hostility from the waiter. Missing items on order so party of 6 ate all at different times. Nice wine menu but tries far too hard for hipster.,0,negative
"Stunning setting, perhaps the most amazing outdoor setting I've experienced. The food was good, better than we expected as many of these types of places rely more on their setting than quality. The staff was exceptional, the lobster bisques very good. Nice hearty martini!",1,positive
"My mother and I came here for Christmas Eve and we were SO PLEASED with the ensemble-style waitstaff. I had the surf and turf and she had the dual lobster tails. Perfectly prepared seafood, very light and buttery--but filling! Amazing ambiance, great food presentation. We came for the view, fell in love with the food. Had no room for dessert! We thought the photographer was a little aggressive, but she took some great photos.",1,positive
"What a treat. A quiet little escape from the airport. Decent selection of Red wines and I found a favorite in the list: Caymus. Many whites though I can't speak to the whites. Really good fresh focused menu with a delicatessen twist. The small cheese plate was good and plentiful. \n\nThe prices are really outrageous, but that is expected for the quality within an airport location.",1,positive
"Simply the Best, need to share at this place as portions are Huge, A++++\nSave room for Sticky pudding, we always start and finish our vacation with a great dinner from Gallagher's Steakhouse",1,positive
"My sister had her wedding reception here on  Friday night and we could not have asked for a better experience! The staff was excellent and the food was delicious! Brittany, the event coordinator was fabulous and attentive. I recommend this restaurant to anyone looking to hold an event. The staff was AWESOME!!! I will tell everyone I know that this is the best place in town for events! Thanks to all the staff for your help! My sister's wedding reception was PERFECT! -Alex",1,positive
"Beautiful restaurant...... you can tell that million of dollars have been spent in this place.\n\nunfortunately the same passion for detail wasn't put in the menu. When I went with a group of friends we weren't impressed with the food, i would say it was below average and very pricey. \n\nMy last visit was when the original chef was still there, i belive he left to open his own restaurant downtown phoenix, some sort of pasta bar, which i am not very exited about knowing this guy ability.",0,negative
"Excellent food, wine, and atmosphere.. First time dinning there but will definitely return..",1,positive
Yeah... I wasn't blown away by this restaurant. I went in there expecting very little. Ask and you shall receive. I wouldn't recommend you go there unless it's your best friend's birthday party and she's been giving you the guilt trip about going.,0,negative
Good atmosphere but the food prices were a little high for what you get. Good deal on wine during happy hour: buy one bottle get another bottle for $1. I was in a large party for a birthday and service was prompt she was kind enough to grab some candles for the birthday girl. We ordered appetizers and my salad which I ordered as an entree was very tasty. I ordered the s'mores for dessert as well. It looked neat at first but the heat was very overwhelming for the table. I would try this place again.,1,positive
My husband and I have been going to Envy for 8 years now. The food is fantastic. The staff is amazing and helpful. I love the atmosphere. The owner came out to congratulate us on our anniversary and brought a card that was signed by the staff. Envy is our anniversary tradition and I don't see that changing any time soon. I've never had a bad experience. Try the truffle fries for an appetizer and the filet mignon for the meal. You won't be disappointed!,1,positive
I love the atmosphere on weekends with the DJ. Now when I say DJ I'm talking about good beats playing in the background when your dinning. Not a club atmosphere with dancing going on everywhere. Amazing specialty drinks and the food is very good as well. Nate was our server he did an amazing job. Decor fits what they are trying to accomplish swanky with a bit of lounge atmosphere.  I gave this a five because it had all the elements that I like in a restaurant.,1,positive
"I was twice taken here and can't speak highly enough of a truly enjoyable dining experience. My host spoke of the flavors, atmosphere and described each food item as if he were painting a picture. I share his enthusiasm.",1,positive
"For the money not even close to worth it. The wait staff, though many, was horrible. It was during the second corse that I had to \""""ask\""""for a cocktail. Steak was not cooked to order, and portions were knoll... Not worth to cost for sure... Funny.... $21 for a glass of Rodney Strong Chardonnay... Really... Been there done thAt and will not return..",0,negative
Great food and very friendly service.  The food was excellent.  The drinks were also delicious.  This is a great date spot. It is fun to sit on the patio.  I would definitely go back!,1,positive
Very low key location in the Palazzo Hotel near sushi samba. Owned by Emeril I expected something great but very so-so. Gumbo with chicken and sausage was fatty and pretty bland. Shrimp with bbq glaze very salty. Service very polite but somewhat overpowering. Short ribs with kale. Kale again over salted but short ribs were really good. It all ended abruptly with a waitress handing over the check before we had a chance to finish the berry cobbler (which was so-so). Overall not recommended.,0,negative
"I stay at the IHotel for business often (bi-weekly) and have had dinner at Houlihan's on many occasions.  This restaurant is very consistent.  I haven't had a bad meal yet.  The filet mignon with mashed potatoes hits the spot on a cold night in U-C.  I'm pretty addicted to their Fat Spaghetti and Potstickers.  Weird combo?  Yes, but I crave them as soon as I check into the hotel.  \n\nThe waitstaff is excellent, but a couple of the hostesses could be a tad \""""warmer\"""".  Overall, this is great spot.",1,positive
"Not a great dining experience. Adequate service, but food is just ok. Definitely didn't love it.",0,negative
"We came here for our anniversary dinner.  First and probably the last time.  It was really LOUD with club/techno music playing, very hard to hear what my hubby was saying.  Our waitress was just blah, didn't know the menu at all and seemed distracted.  The food was interesting/fine.  We spent too much money for the experience we had.  Too bad, wanted to love the place.",0,negative

"If you want an out-of-this-world dining experience - this is the place!!! The atmosphere is elegant and comfortable done in style! The service is phenomenal! The food is to die for!!! Watch their video via their website before going and eat strategically to get your money's worth....\n\nThis place is expensive - check their web site for current prices. I wouldn't bring small children here and I would recommend at bare minimum, dress jeans and a polo shirt.\n\nA solid 5 stars!!!",1,positive

"Cute atmosphere.  We started off with the sliders and sad to say the little miny buns were hard as a ROCK!.  Wine is served in stemless glasses - which is a NO-NO.  Ordered the passion fruit creme brulee and it was ok.  Overall, a 3 for OK.  Wasn't wowed, but may give them a second chance.  Sorry to do this, but I have to go with a 2-star for this place. Over-rated.",0,negative
"The food and service were excellent. I would recommend a reservation on the weekends as the place had a 2 hour wait when I was there on a Saturday night. Our waiter was knowledgeable and enthusiastic.  \n\nThe swordfish, mac & cheese, wine list, were all top notch. I was not too crazy about the green beans though.",1,positive
"What an amazing view! They can serve me turds on a plate and would still give it 5 stars base soley on the view!\n\nThe prices aren't cheap, but not over expensive either. They could charge much more based on location in my book.\n\nThe steaks are awesome, and the salads are super yum!  I would say it's a great date spot!",1,positive

Great ambiance. Old house converted to a restaurant. It has a cozy feel to it.\n\nC and I shared the paella. Very good. Then had two deserts. One was a pear cake and the other something with hazelnuts. Both excellent. Good service.,1,positive
"Very disappointing. Expensive & nothing special. While they did have caviar, something we haven't found elsewhere, nothing else impressed us. Also the service was subpar. Not only was our waiter unattentive, the lead hostess was making snide remarks about guests, and when we needed service & asked for help from other servers they simply said \""""we cannot help you, that's not our section\"""". We will not be coming back here ever again, especially having paid over $90 for 2 people.",0,negative

When I finally pointed out to him that my rose champaign somehow got substituted by a rose wine, he offered to fix a mistake, but never did. Had my husband not checked with another waiter on the status of his mojjito, it would have never arrived. The entire experience was on a C- level. Spend tour money at other restaurants and stay away from Todd English's Olives.",0,negative
Unique and flavorful dishes set Cork apart from other restaurants in the Chandler area. However it is a bit pricey and service was a little slow on this occasion.  Went back as part of AZ restaurant week in the spring and it was the best of our 3 visits so far.  Great food and service!,1,positive

"Came here for a late dinner one night after we came back from touring the Grand Canyon. I really like the decoration of the venue, really reminded me of Malibu. There's a certain fusion feeling to the dishes they offered and a very cali-vibe. I had the mussles and my friend had the Chinese salad. We both really like our entrees. Portions were huge--but that's because the dishes are also pricey. I wished my mussles didn't come with the frieds--it was pretty heavy. Otherwise, the taste was great. Great great service!",1,positive
"Agree with the other reviewers.  Very \""""hotel restaurant\"""" interior, but don't let that turn you off because the food is super yum!\n\nI got the shrimp po' boy and holy moly it was big and packed such a punch of flavor.  Shrimp crispy, spicy remoulade extra zingy and hoagie crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  Love! \n\nI'm also a huge fan that the fries are beer battered which spiced up your normal fries on the side thang.  \n\nThey have a great Yelp check in offer.  Buy one beer get the other free.

"Went there for my father's 80th birthday.  Excellent.  My parents both ordered the fillet mignon, which was very flavorful.  The butter on top helps.  I got the fillet medallions.  I found the sauce and crust to be slightly too overpowering on the fillet, but it was still very good.  Our waiter, Frank, was very personable and made us feel right at home.",1,positive
"We had a party of seven, all ordered something different and everyone thought their plate was the best. From Osso Buco to swordfish to vegetarian lasagne, we all shared tastes and all agreed it was excellent. \n\nThe service and menu knowledge of the waiters was excellent. Not to mention the owner who walks from table to table chatting it up.\n\nWe enjoyed everything about this restaurant.\n\nVisited July 2013",1,positive
"The service is outstanding, food great, and the wine recommendation was solid!",1,positive
"Charming atmosphere...good drinks, great dessert but the middle was totally lacking.\n\nI couldn't even take more than 3 bites of the Montilana beef in sherry wine sauce if that's what you call it. It was god awful. I haven't had a bad meal like that in ages.\n\nThe server didn't even bother to ask if I wanted something else. I don't call that good service.\n\nThe mexican con leche cake was good, but I won't be jumping up and down to have dinner there again!",0,negative
"Great atmosphere, fun environment, but rather lousy food.  Had crab chowder, and octopus appetizers, and lobster risotto, and 2nd fish on the menu, Hawaiian donuts for dessert.  The best, and only good dish was the mashed potato side that we ordered.  The rest was mediocre to poor.",0,negative
"I can honestly say this was one of the best dinning experiences I have ever had. I took my parents their for there anniversary and they loved it. The food was excellent and the service was top notch. I highly recommend you check out the \""""Feed Me Chef\"""" menu.",1,positive
Liked the a la carte appetizer concept. My food was good and decent craft beer selection. Server was friendly. Main negative was loud music made it difficult to converse. Pounding bass of techno music reverberated so you could literally feel it.  Asked if it could be slightly reduced but it was not possible. Seriously guys if the music was less deafening you'd still be hip and people could actually converse and enjoy the without shouting. If I had read this review I would have known to choose a different restaurant.,0,negative
I was there for my birthday and Leo(our waiter) was awesome. He's funny and he take good care of us. The food was great. The dessert was mouthwatering... you definetly need to eat there..,1,positive
Great ambience. Love the red walls and fake candle lit tables. The server (wish I remembered his name) was so great. He was warm and friendly. The server gave us tasters of the sangria which I ended up ordering two glasses. Yum. The food was above average. Overall this place was great and glad to find it. Seems like a fun place go come to for brunch with the girls and drink sangria.,1,positive
"Perfect place for date night on the patio.  Food was delicious especially the Barratta and the Lamb.   \n\nOur server, Emily, made it a particularly amazing experience.  Good food is ubiquitous but we find great service rare in Arizona.  I hope the owners recognize the value she brings to their venue.  We will definitely return and we will certainly request her section.",1,positive
The ladies love it. Romantic setting with pretty typical high end menu. Food is very good but not unique.  Neat setting in a very high end residential area. Good but not great.,1,positive
"Loved this place - from the excellent service by our waitress, Ashley, to the great food - an all-around great experience.  Ashley was knowledgeable about the wine and menu items and gave us samples so we could decide between two we were considering.  We will be back.",1,positive
"Not impressed at all. Because of how great Craftsteak is, some friends and I tried out Heritage. The highlight of the meal was my friend's Shirley Temple. The pork belly appetizer was bland. The bone in rib eye was really dry and had no taste. Onion rings were cool. I don't remember if they had a bread basket. If they did, it certainly was forgettable. Overall, I would pick Tom Colicchio Craftsteak and a ton of other Vegas steakhouses over this place. Only slightly better than Sugar Factory (and that place really sucks)",0,negative
"Totally an awesome experience. Uber friendly staff, great value for steaks and quick service. \n\nManager even checked in to see how are first dinning experience was going. The bread is fantastically nummy...",1,positive
"My impression was what's an amazing restaurant like this doing in a small SW strip mall? This place should be in the Bellagio I'm serious! Absolutely amazing all around.\n\nDefinitely take the time to come eat here,\nYou will fall in love with the place..\nDW BISTRO",1,positive
What a great unique place! Great atmosphere! It's as authentic as it gets! After living in Ireland and traveling around Europe this has a divine find. English food is good..don't believe me try this place! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the service is OK at best.,1,positive
"The food really good, and the service was great.  WE sat in the bar for a change.  More quaint than the restaurant seating.  We both enjoyed a gyro platter.  One shared could have easily fed the two of us, so we took the rest home for another meal.  I give it 2 thumbs up.",1,positive
"When we drove up to Pearl for the first time, it appeared very upscale, lighting, high ceilings, modern furniture. However, not so much. The decor tries to be upscale, but the plastic dishes and junk cluttering the walkway to the patio brings it down. Service is excellent, but there is no gluten free menu, and staff is not aware of gluten free items, except for gluten free soy sauce. Food was fine. Lots of fun drinks. If they are trying to appeal to the average working non-celiac patron, they've succeeded.",0,negative
"Excellent lunch!!!!!!\nGreat value!\nGreat wine!\nGreat atmosphere!\n\nThe only negative, I don't care for valet parking.",1,positive
"We first ate at Roy's at their Kauai location. I'm glad to say that their food is as good in the desert as in the middle of the ocean. \n\nService is always good, food for the most part has been delicious, save a couple times were a new entree or appetizer didn't lived up to the waiter/waitress hype.\n\nThe drinks are very good, perfect blend of alcohol and mixers. I am not a wine connoisseur but the times I ordered wine by the glass I have been more than happy with my selection.\n\nOverall, good food and service.",1,positive
"The food was amazing. All 8 of us at the table really liked everything we ordered. The cupcakes were blah. Our table shared 4 different kinds. I'd go back for dinner anytime, but never eat dessert there again.",1,positive
"My boyfriend came here to their bistro for our anniversary. It's hidden in a back room of a flower shop. I guess the idea for the owners is to sell flowers and trinkets as well as fine dining. And fine dining it was; I can't wait to go back! I'm sorry I can't write a better review because it was a year or so ago when I went but trust me, the food's good go asap. This place needs to be in a better location...",1,positive
"Couldn't have asked for a better eating experience!  From the moment we walked in, we were treated like royalty.  Fabulous appetizers, salads and the steaks are unbelievable.  Service was impeccable, very attentive, friendly and knowledgable.  I would recommend this place to anyone and everyone....",1,positive
"I have attended two different events that Emery's had catered and enjoyed the food at both events, and it's located within walking distance from my house, so my husband and I decided to celebrate an anniversary there.  The bruschietta was excellent, the pasta was mediocre and the service atrocious!  We are usually easy to please, but sitting with empty drink glasses for about 30 minutes really irked me.  I was not impressed with their in house dining experience, but they seem to be decent caterers.",0,negative
Except for the deal on wine ($5 for a decent glass)  I can't recommend this place.  The food is blah.  I mean its not bad but the atmosphere sets you up for expecting alot more.,0,negative
"Expensive but not worth it, factory dining experience not personable and not engaging staff. While it might work for 2ppl, this is second time I've been with a group that things just didn't click. So many staff and hustle an bustle, but no engagement. Food was pretty good. Calamari weak, osso buco, unimpressive, tagliatelle was awesome as was tomato salad. Good wine list",0,negative
"Extremely underwhelming experience. Drinks, appetizers, and entrees took forever.. And on a Tuesday night. Everything was painfully salty, very true to the name. Pretty overpriced for such a mediocre dining experience.",0,negative

The atmosphere is nice and intimate. Our server was very nice (Claire) and was quick to ask us if we needed anything. We ordered the tuna tartare for an appetizer and it was good for two and yummy!! I ordered the Manhattan steak with  twiced baked potato which was amazing!! Loved the food and drinks (try the Kentucky Buck) and had a nice dinner!! Can't wait to come back soon!!,1,positive
"Very nice place. Food was very good and they had a lot of variety. Not too expensive, but not cheap either.\n\nThere was a long wait to get a table and staff wasn't too friendly at times.",1,positive
5 stars for the service\nour waiter is amazing! \n\nfood has nice presentation.  taste is above average. (3.5 stars)\nordered \n\nseafood platter- crab legs are too salty\nsteak--ordered medium rare but cooked more like medium\nlobster\nenvy salad\nsticky caramel pudding--warm and very good!\n\nBest to make reservation ahead for the booth (if 2 people),1,positive
"My husband and I went with some friends for dinner and we had a great time. We sat outside, so I didn't get a good feel for what the inside was like, but my overall impression was clean and comfortable.\n\nThis place has great pricing for EVERYTHING during their happy hour. We got entirely too much food and drink, but we definitely left happy!\n\nThe food was really unique and had fun twists on old favorites. It's nice when restaurants put thought into their menus!",1,positive
"We decided to come here because of their great specials- Wednesdays you get 20% off your entire bill\n\nGreat wine and beer list, good cocktails plus a low-calorie cocktail list- we had some delicious sangria \n\nNice outdoor patio and bar area with a lot of seating\n\nOverall the food was pretty good - great for a casual weeknight meal. I would definitely go back for a reasonable, low key dinner",1,positive
"Excellent tasty food, excellent value for money.\nThere was loads to eat in our plates and we were served really quickly. Perfect little restaurant for a date!",1,positive
First time and wasn't disappointed! The ambiance was definitely upscale for a Thai place and the food and service were upscale as well !  We found a great new Thai place near home that is perfact for a date night or family dinner!,1,positive
"Great food, great staff! Had a wonderful steak with a nice cabernet... Manager was extremely tentative to all patrons...I would definitely go again.",1,positive
the service was excellent the food was good not 100% amazing the prices are very high and I will definitely say when food is worth it and I think it was semi worth it. Great ambiance very romantic. I dont think I would go back but I do think it was a good experience,1,positive
"The place doesn't look the best but food is excellent and the service is fantastic!  My husband always gets pizza or open face roast beef n gravy. I get lasagna (which gives me 3meals) or a sandwich. My granddaughter's love to go there. They get there own personal pizza which is huge. Big Jim's was also on \""""Diners, Drive in and Dives\"""". Guy showed the spaghetti being made, he gave the recipe. Also, I forgot to mention they have the best wedding soup in Pittsburgh.",1,positive
It was an ok experience. The food was good and having to cook it yourself was fun for a family. Was it the best food I have ever had? no. The building is quite old and it seemed very dark in there. The floor was sticky and the table also was sticky. I guess I am not in a huge hurry to go back.,0,negative
"Seating is comfortable and lounge style.  The wine list is OK, not many high end wines, but still a good selection for most people. I enjoyed the steak salad and the antipasto board for sharing between two people. Service was great. Nice date night.",1,positive
"Excellent cuisine, polite staff and awesome view! We were seated right by the window for a perfect sunset view. Ordered the spicy crab salad for appetizer and it's highly recommended. Would definitely come back again! :]",1,positive
Not much to rave about this place. \n\nFood presentation was bland. The food itself was ok. The only thing extraordinary about this place were the prices. $40 for about 4 ounces of bison meat. We sat outside and had nature's droppings landing in our glasses and our table. \n\nI've had better dining experiences.,0,negative
"No higher than two stars. Service friendly. Food expensive, yet very basic. No wow factor here. Chart House a better choice. Medium crowd, yet they put us right at tables next to one another limiting privacy.",0,negative
"When I went here, I dined outside so I can't say too much about the interior.  My first impression was that it looked a little cramped inside.  Perhaps they were going for the cozy feel.\n\nThe food and the service, on the other hand, we top notch.  We had seafood and it was amazing; complimented by an international wine list.   Since it was a sunday evening when I dined here, it wasn't very crowded, but with the way the place was laid out I'm sure it is a local hot spot.  Definitely a trendy place to take a date.",1,positive
"Loved this place.  Very quaint atmosphere.  Live music on a Friday night.  I had the chicken parmesan and the bf ordered the gnocci.  We both really enjoyed our dishes.  We had a groupon and were never given that \""""oh, you have a groupon?\"""" attitude. Service was also excellent.  Will return!",1,positive
"I guy named Stephen from NY reviewed this place perfectly. Look at his review.\n\n I felt like it was a dining room at a fancy retirement home in the basement of a janky casino. The salad was great and everything else excluding the entree was nice, but the entree was very underwhelming. I was glad we bought a coupon for 25% off our bill from Tix 4 Tonight because I would have felt ripped off without it.",0,negative
"I took my wife here for our anniversary last year. The service was outstanding (I think we had three waiters just for our table) and the food was excellent. I had the sea bass and she had the pork chops, both were cooked perfectly and tasted wonderful. For desert they had root beer ice cream and I swear it felt like it was carbonated. The decor was OK but they could do a little more.",1,positive
"This was our first time here and we loved it! Great service, prices were good, food was phenomenal. Couldn't ask for anything better, only concern is that the entire restaurant is booths so I don't see how I could bring in a large party..",1,positive
"Food was average. Service average. Not worth the price at all. I was looking forward to a great dinner before a music show at the Cosmopolitan, and was really disappointed. Nothing was horrible. But nothing was impressive either. A bunch of servers hanging around doing nothing and we still had to wait 45 min for our food.",0,negative
"5 star view, good decor.  Good, pricey drinks, not too excessive though considering the venue.  We had bolognese fries which were not good.  I should have sent them back, but i eat what's in front of me if it's edible.  Service was a bit slow.  It took a while to place our order, but once we did they came out in a reasonable amount of time.",1,positive

"We had the pre-theater dinner at $55 and it was great. Appetiser, entree, dessert & coffee. Excellent menu selection. Everything was prepared and served perfectly. Good portions. Very professional staff. I thought the mid-century decor would be \""""\""""dated\""""\"""" but it was not. The rooms are spacious and lovely. You do not feel crowded and they don't rush you. You're there for a first rate dinner experience, and that's what you get.",1,positive
"The food, decor and the service were absolutely great! Their bread cart and the sweet treat cart were great additions to an amazing experience. I didn't try the 16 course because I didn't want to miss out on the carts. The langoustine ravioli and the caviar were the my two most favorite dishes. And if you are a foi gras fan, you must try theirs!",1,positive
"It's just delicious! The food is very tender and tasteful. We had the short ribs, amazing flavor, and I had the filet which melts in your mouth. Our only criticism is the bartender throwing empty bottles in the trash which is loud and reminiscent of a college bar at 1:00am. We loved the food and the view, it's a definite thumbs up!",1,positive
Very solid experience.  good food. good ambiance. good location.  good staff (cute waiter!) and over all very plesant.  Went before a show at the smith center and they made sure to get us out in time to get to the show before curtain.  I appreciated the decor of the place the most.  Very urban.  The waitress was a little unhelpful when we were placing out order but still highly recommended and worth a visit.,1,positive
Don't need to say much. The service is perfect.. u have like 3ppl serve ur table and the wayagu steak is melt in your mouth.. what else can you ask for with a glass a red wine.. uhmm..,1,positive
"Located on the ground floor of New York, New York next to the casino, not a great location.  Hostess was nice, seated us right away.  Waiter didn't start off very good, had to ask for him a couple times to take our order.\n\nFood was mediocre, Fornaio salad was just ok, very hard croutons and had a very small slice of cheese.  For the main entree, I had the tortelinni special that was pretty good but very small portion.  I probably won't be back as there are much better options.",0,negative
Excellent food and atmosphere.  Seated on-time and our waiter was very attentive. Had Pear & Endive Salad and Sole. Only complaint is one bathroom for men and one for women. First time ever saw a line for mens room!,1,positive
"Very high end buffet. The atmosphere and decorating is absolutely beautiful. It has a large and varied selection of good food.The only negative was the price of $45 for dinner.\n\nExc - Feel, food.\nGood - None\nAve - None\nPoor -  Pricey!\n\n\nWOULD I GO BACK? POSSIBLY, ABSOLUTELY IF I AM COMPED!",1,positive

Music is great!!   Service a bit lacking    Items don't match what's written in the menu.  Daughter ordered popcorn shrimp but they served 3 big butterflied shrimp instead \nI ordered meat ravioli but got some pesto mish mosh instead     Decent but not traditional meat ravioli.  \nWould come back just to have dinner on the patio with live music,0,negative
Went to dinner here tonight and It was a very pleasant experience. We purchased the group on for $11 and our meal was $21.30.  Food was delicious and service was very friendly. Our server checked on us in a timely manner and refilled our water and drinks. Very nice little restaurant and close to my house. Definitely will be returning here,1,positive
"The wine tasted gross, I've never tasted wine like it before with a very weird aftertaste. I wouldn't recommend any of the red wines in particular. Not only that, but the food wasn't that great-the apples tasted and smelled nasty on the fruit and cheese plate. My low rating has to do more with their food and wine. Other than that service was fine, they were understaffed but gave us free truffles to make up for it (cute bartender).",0,negative
This place was fun from start to finish.  It's 3am and the place is packed that's a good sign.  I have to wait for a table only 10 mins or so but the hostess was playful and funny so the time flew by.  Once seated the waitress was at the table and taking drink orders within a min of being seated.  There are a lot of choices on the menu.  The food was yummy and I will be back for sure.  All in all this was a nice change of pace for me and the total experience was fun and friendly.,1,positive
"This place exceeded my expectations. My husband and I wanted to go on a romantic dinner to celebrate our wedding anniversary. We heard about Elements that had incredible  views and amazing food with an top master chef. The services was impeccable, and the food is to die for. They even provided us a dessert on the house to celebrate our anniversary. This restaurant is good for first dates, to celebrate a special occasion or if your looking to have a good time. We look forward to coming back!",1,positive
"this review will be short, as although my time there was rather lengthy i only had one item off the menu.  well three really, as in three glasses of pinot noir which i can highly recommend.  the place itself is also quiet nice, loads of tablse and chair so easy to get a seat, not quite as easy to get the attention of the wait staff who insist on table service.  but overall a really nice place to go for a drink.",1,positive

"Good food and great service!  My friend and I both enjoyed our meals.  The atmosphere is nice, especially if you sit out on the patio during the summer.  It's a great place to people watch while sipping margaritas. The waitress and owner were both friendly and I would definitely go back.",1,positive
"We spent our 1-yr anniversary here... excellent service, tasty food.  We definately enjoyed ourselves. It was really noisy inside, but it made it feel less stuffy which was nice. The french onion soup & their warm bread was awsome.  The steaks were tasty, but lacked just a little in flavor. The coctails were very good!",1,positive
"Low stars based on service and food (wine selection and ambiance are not bad) \n\nIf you want to go here on date, this is a great spot- it's romantic with the dark lighting and intimate seating. \n\nIf you want to take a group, maybe try another place- It seems very difficult for them to bring out food for large groups in a timely manner. Also, splitting the check must be rocket science because on various occasions they were not able to.",0,negative
"I was very impressed with how pretty and open the restaurant was. I really enjoyed bringing my out of town guest here for lunch. The food was BETTER than I expected. I would go here again.

"My family and I booked a party here for my brother's birthday.\nThe atmosphere, decor, and view are all great. \nIt was suprisingly slow when we first arrived but got busier as our evening went on.\nStaff was polite and attentive. Our waitress Christina checked in on us often and even had the music changed when we asked for something other than dance/techno.\nFood was better than expected however the pizza was really greasy.\nA great place to have a party with family or friends. I reccomend it!",1,positive
"Very good food and friendly service.  The menu is not huge, but original and dishes are made with local ingredients.  I would highly recommend Haggis and smoked salmon to start. We had lamb and cod for main course.  Cod was just about perfect.  \n Cannot beat the location - right on the Royal Mile.  We had a table for two next to the window overlooking the Royal mile.  Most of the restaurant is down stairs, so if you want the view, you should us for a table on the first floor.   \nWell worth the time and money.",1,positive
"Pure perfection!  We had a group of 20 eat here for a family reunion and everything was perfect.  The seating as great, we had two kids with us who were treated well.  The restaurant put together a prix fixe dinner for us that as outstanding.  We had two vegan diners with us and the chefs prepared special dishes for them.  Everyone's steaks were prepared perfectly.  The sides dinners and wine choices were great.  And the creme brulee was amazing.  Thanks for a great meal and excellent service.",1,positive
"Excellent restaurant and dining experience.  The menu here changes seasonally (I had the summer menu) and Tom Kitchin really focuses on getting the best ingredients.  The bone marrow with Devon snails, Perthshire girolles, and Bayonne ham is one of those dishes you remember for a long time. \n\nThe service was attentive (without being intrusive), knowledgeable, and people were really warm. Chef Kitchin was actually in the kitchen cooking.  You don't see many celebrity chefs cooking anymore - at least not in NYC.",1,positive
"Roland's was recommended by hotel. Service was terrible. Food was cold. Brick oven pizza cold.... Asked to have it reheated, still came back cold. Steak was way over cooked. Never got appetizer we ordered, but was charged for it.  Was not busy but waitress was hard  to find. Would not go back and would not recommend this place to anyone.",0,negative
"The food was okay, but what brings people here is the Mighty Wurlitzer organ. The musicians are amazing. They take requests and play without sheet music. As much as I enjoy the professional musicianship, sometimes the medleys repeat and seem like they never end. We requested Phantom of the Opera (I'm sure they get that a lot), but it wasn't as grandiose as I had hoped. Extremely entertaining nonetheless. Sitting in the restaurant feels like sitting in a smaller version of Hofbrauhaus.\n\nThe restaurant only takes cash.",1,positive
Loved this place.  My friend and I each had a lamb dish-- a self-proclaimed specialty of the house.  My rack of lamb with goat cheese was fantastic-- would not change a thing.  Service was superb (ma\u00eetre d Lorenzo!!) and responsive and wine selection solid.  Just a really top-notch experience all around.,1,positive

Fantastic!  Don't miss eating here..we had 2 breakfasts and lunch and should have gone there for dinner as well...fabulous food..fabulous service and great atmosphere...there is always a line for street seating but they have a room with all glass so you are enjoying the outdoors just as well and no lines...indoor seating is just as nice..loved it!!!!,1,positive
"Not so good experience there. They made us wait a lot without even asking for the drinks. The salad bar was too small for the place and with no variety at all. At one point someone that looked as the owner started arguing with one of the waiters in front of the customers, not a nice experience. The food was good, but not remarkable.",0,negative
"Their prix fixe dinner was a delight. We went here for a celebration, and it was a nice, intimate experience with delicious food and attentive but non-intrusive waitstaff.  We did notice that a head waiter appeared to be training our waiter but it was early evening.  The menus change regularly.",1,positive
"I was not happy with this establishment. Originally, we were to have dinner at Nine Steakhouse. However, due to forces that we could not control (i.e. hostess error & incompetence), our reservations were not listed and thus we were sent to Nove. Although Nove attempted to live up to the reputation of Nine, however, they failed ... completely.  The one redeeming quality was the wine storage facility.  It was pretty. It changed colors... many times.",0,negative
"A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. ( Amazingly expensive too, but well worth it! )\nEverything is exquisite. Really, I could write forever, going through every single dish we had, but it's a waste of my time. There was NOTHING bad here. If you can afford it ( $$$$ ), this is one of my highest recommendations of a restaurant anywhere in the world.",1,positive
Like all other Gordon Ramsay restaurants this place is sure to impress. Every detail is carefully engineered down to the outfits that the bus boys wear. The food is amazing and all of the staff is well educated about it and the amazing wine/beer list. The vibe is upscale/energetic and fun with a british twist. Loved it!,1,positive
"Approved. Delicious food and really really great atmosphere. Highly recommended. Sunday brunch was packed and the wait staff was unable to keep up with everything. Hangar steak with eggs was good and the spaghetti with meatballs looked really good. The portions were a little small, but perfect for all those young skinny bankers who like to hang out at places like this. Sit outside if you can. I'd go back.",1,positive
"Good food, very tasty, place is very nice and intimate inside. Place looks closed and dark from the outside, but they are open, they just have curtains blocking the windows. Portions could definitely be a little more for the price, but it was good.",1,positive

We loved cocos its like your fav hometown dinner . Treated us like they new us made us feel right at home and we never been there before. food wasgood  chocolate cream pie was awesome. Prices were great. Would highly recommend this place,1,positive
"The location and architecture was beautiful, but the service was severely lacking. Service was quite slow, the queso appetizer was tiny, I received the wrong entree, and it took half an hour to get the check at the end. They seemed to be closing up the restaurant well before the hours stated, and decided to ignore us for most of the evening.\n\nI will give this restaurant another chance, but just for drinks, definitely not for dinner.",0,negative
Great food.. Service was alright. Everyone helped us BUT our server. It took 20 minutes for a shot of alcohol to get to our table. Other than that nice place and atmosphere. I took my boyfriend here for his birthday.,1,positive

My pear endive salad was great and my filet mignon medallion was phenomenal! We were a party if 8 and everyone raved about the food! I have dined here several times and have never been disappointed!",1,positive
"Excellent, We went last night to celebrate my parents 40th Anniversary.  Food was great! Our server Rachael did a awesome job.  The restaurant had neat character,it was a bit loud but it is small, so that's expected.  Wonderful all around.",1,positive
The atmosphere in this restaurant is truly authentic. The experience is a once in a lifetime opportunity. The food was great. The dancer was amazing. The wait staff friendly. The music divine. The owner amiable. Everything was perfect here. My only complaint would be the price which without a Groupon would be much to pricy to frequent too often. Go here for the experience of a lifetime,1,positive
"My boyfriend and I ate here for our anniversary and the view, food, and service were great! And might I add, very romantical.\n\nThe lobster bisque, filet mignon, and alaskan king crab legs were all melt in your mouth delicious. It is a bit pricey but you basically get what you pay far.\n\nGreat place for a date or even a fancy night out with friends.",1,positive
"As advertised this is a nice place. Beautiful spot on the end of city north.\nI was there for a business dinner this week and had an overall good experience. The service was good, food tasty, and had some fun people watching. I actually had steak, just In that mood that night. The filet was yummy and cooked perfectly. The sides were fine but nothing spectacular.\n\nIs this place better than ocean club? I don't think so. But it was a solid meal. I would not hesitate to go back.",1,positive
"Excellent food at reasonable prices. Great service. Didn't have wine with dinner, but they have a huge selection.",1,positive
"The food here is pricey, but well worth it. The sides are served family style so you may only need two or three for the whole table. The steaks are perfectly cooked and the cuts of meat are the best of quality.\n\nThis particular location offers a cool area to sit in if you are fortunate enough to be seated there. It is a pod-like structure that is in the middle of the hotel atrium. It feels very cool and adds to the experience.\n\nIf you are looking to go big, this is a great place to do it!",1,positive
"Very Very disappointing! Poor service, there were only three occupied tables during our experience.  Waitress kept trying to take away my Sake sangria before I was finished.  But did not offer to fill my empty water glass, the miso salmon arrived before my watermelon and goat cheese plate.  Drinks were horrible !For two people lunch was over $70.00, and not satisfying. Will not do that again.  I liked Petras much better.",0,negative
"Food was amazing.  The terrace with the fountains made for a very unique dining experience, but indoor would have been more romantic for us.  Service was on par for a restaurant of this level.  Cost was less than what I expected for a restaurant of this level.  I would recommend this restaurant for anyone in Las Vegas.",1,positive
"Not impressed... Eaten there several times and each time I think it might be better the next time, not the case... Its more of a tourist trap style cooking... That being said the outdoor area is great but drink cost is high... If you have family in from out of town its cute to check out and take pictures. Two thumbs down on dining, two thumbs down on drink prices, and one thumb up for atmosphere if they decide to stay open past 10pm on some night...",0,negative
A palace indeed!  Had the pleasure of having a late dinner and had my reservations as I walked into a nearly empty dining room.  Our waiter was awesome and was extremely welcoming.  Not too familiar with this type of cuisine so I relied heavily on recommendations.  Unfortunately I can't remember what I ordered... but I do remember enjoying it thoroughly.  I even requested 2nd's to take home for lunch the next day.  Stop by and give it a go!,1,positive
"Reasonable Prices, Tasty Dishes\n\nThe executive chef used to work at social house and borrowed some of the recipes.  The fish tasted fresh and the combinations of flavors worked.  The prices were very reasonable, and the restaurant was causal.  It was a nice location for a first date, and I would go back again.",1,positive
First time there.  It was a Sunday night so the wine was 1/2 off which made us very happy.  Food was excellent.  Had the pad thai and a shrimp and scallops dish.  \n\nMy only complaint is that it was really hot seated near the window as the sun was going down.  We didn't linger as a result.,1,positive
Don't need to say much. The service is perfect.. u have like 3ppl serve ur table and the wayagu steak is melt in your mouth.. what else can you ask for with a glass a red wine.. uhmm..,1,positive
Food was very good and presentation is excellent.   This is Champaign's version of  a Manhattan bistro.,1,positive
"I'm not much of a foodie, so I'm sure I didn't appreciate this place as much as I could have, but the food was tasty and the main dish portion was large.  A tad expensive for my taste but it was worth it for the atmosphere and delicious food.\n\nMy group had the pork chop, lamb shank, beef cheeks and more and all was very tasty and generous portions.  The chefs choice pintxo's were also very good.  The atmosphere was very tasteful and upscale.\n\nI would return for special occasions.",1,positive
"Expensive, $88.00 for 2 for dinner, and food was below average.  Not to mention it's location is at the very back secluded area of the cosmopolitan.  Complete disappointment!",0,negative
"Came here for my birthday lunch. I loved the layout and decor. It was very comfortable. I'm used to small plate dishes in Mediterranean restaurants, and was surprised this place wasn't like that. The meals were fairly large. The food was flavorful and appetizing. I will definitely go back and think its a place that all those interested in Mediterranean or Moroccan cuisine should try.",1,positive
"Good service, and okay wine selection. Food was below average lack of flavor, not cooked to correct temperate. So many people have recommend this as a must try restaurant, it is not worth a 2nd visit. Prices are priced well for the items they sold however the quality of ingredients and preparation of food served was equal to a home prepared meal.",0,negative
"The location and architecture was beautiful, but the service was severely lacking. Service was quite slow, the queso appetizer was tiny, I received the wrong entree, and it took half an hour to get the check at the end. They seemed to be closing up the restaurant well before the hours stated, and decided to ignore us for most of the evening.\n\nI will give this restaurant another chance, but just for drinks, definitely not for dinner.",0,negative
"This is a very short review.\n\nThis place served me the best meal I've had in years, and I'm enormously happy it's open; it's spendy, but damn, if you're going out for a good dinner, this is the place I'd recommend, hands down.\n\nPhenomenal.  Perfect.  No fault.  Awesome.  Great.  Stellar.  Wooo.",1,positive
"The food was really delicious, the staff was very kind and attentive.\n\nI really liked how they served the food to us and the timing of the service was also spot on.\n\nI really like the authenticity of the menu and I think that the ambiance is very romantic. I had a very relaxing evening there with my boyfriend.",1,positive
"We had a company office dinner here and had a great experience.  The service was outstanding and food was very delicious. However, the inside of this place is outdated and needs a face lift.   Well be back again...",1,positive
"Food was good with very generous portions.  1 meal is enough to split for 2 people. The atmosphere was meh, but our waiter was outstanding.  Not only did he continuously check on us, but the others were stopping by consistently to fill out drinks and clear our tables.  Highly recommended if you are looking to get stuffed for cheap.",1,positive
Solid four. Patio dining was excellent. Fire pits everywhere and great food. Server seemed new and did not know a lot about the menu. Not at a problem though as the food makes up for all. Great wine collection.,1,positive
food was GREAT price  isnt too bad either\n\nLoved my waitress she was super nice\n\nthe decor is very impressive a little dark but i enjoyed the ambiance\nmusic wasnt to loud and the the service was quick \n\nno complaints..,1,positive
"Loved this place.  Very quaint atmosphere.  Live music on a Friday night.  I had the chicken parmesan and the bf ordered the gnocci.  We both really enjoyed our dishes.  We had a groupon and were never given that \""""oh, you have a groupon?\"""" attitude. Service was also excellent.  Will return!",1,positive
"Wine list was great, however I would say service was absent.  I figure the food would make up for the service considering other yelp reviews but again was disappointing.  Prices are a bit high for the quality of food, I felt the dishes are a bit amature.  Bruschetta seemed like it was made with toast and pana cotta was comparable to a store bought mix from a box.  If you are looking for old world Itallian food I suggest going else where.",0,negative
"Great atmosphere. Amazing food. A very cozy and homy energy to the entire dining experience. Definitely worth going to for a fantastic memory.\n\nI stayed to watch some of the food be prepped for the dinner that night, I went for lunch, and the amount of care and attention the chef puts into each step and ingredient is something to be marveled at.",1,positive
"Food were nice but way too expensive. We waited too long between orders (waiters said too many orders and they all messed up). The waiter set us in an awful spot (in a grim corner). Last order around 9:30 PM or earlier, be prepared for that.",0,negative
"The restaurant was very cozy and the waitress was very sweet.Thought the menu was very limited.Had the margarita pizza .Took about half an hour to get, which I thought was way to long.Had high expectations after reading all the reviews, but very ordinary.I had a pizza from  dominos delivery company the other night which was far better.I guess most people have never really had outstanding pizza in the Summerlin area.Wine list also very bland and overpriced.",0,negative
"Another overpriced and overrated  restaurant in the Valley.  Had an arugula salad that appeared mixed with other lettuce - was overly dressed, to the point of have soggy veggies.  Followed by the halibut which had a strangely metallic taste to it - definitely pass on this.  Not worth the splurge.Lackluster in my book, perhaps more of a 1 1/2 star place.\n\nThe ambiance is quaint, the service good - the waitresses wore matching dresses, but with a lower than necessary neckline, revealing more than necessary.  Easy parking.",0,negative
"I went here for a business dinner as it was close to where I had a meeting.  I was a little skeptical but once we met the hostess everything was top notch.  The cocktails were well prepared, the service staff was great.  The food came on time and one of our party sent something back and the manager personally delivered it to us with an apology.  great service and great Ribeye steak.",1,positive
"Not so good experience there. They made us wait a lot without even asking for the drinks. The salad bar was too small for the place and with no variety at all. At one point someone that looked as the owner started arguing with one of the waiters in front of the customers, not a nice experience. The food was good, but not remarkable.",0,negative
It was Interesting... and decent... but I should of saved my money... I watched Guy give this place raves on TV... I am not sure it's all that... but over all interesting food that was good. :-),0,negative
Had high expectations.  Was very disappointed.  Beautiful restaurant and scenery but the food was over rated.   Awful crab cake.  Filets were not good at all. Donovan's on camelback is 100 times better.  \nLike I said if you don't care about your food and are looking for cool views and ambience this place is it!,0,negative
"Food is good and reasonably priced. Just look at all the photos posted here!  The staff is very pleasant. We were very pleased with the service.  I was afraid they couldn't accommodate a party if 6 because the place looks so tiny from the front, but there is a decent (small sized) dining room in the rear.",1,positive
"Food was very good. The waiter warned us about \""""European\"""" sized portions...and suggested that we order appetizer/salad and entree....which I thought was a little weird...but not offensive. (Like we'd never been in an upscale restaurant before)  Service was good without being fussy.  Wine was reasonably priced....with a great deal on bottles.  Didn't have dessert, but it looked tempting. We will definitely go back.",1,positive
The prices are average but the food is above average. The portions were generous and everything was well made. \nAlthough the seating area seems generic I would have given 5 stars if the service had been better.,1,positive
"Big wine list. Impressive setting and location, and the servers were both polite and professional. I would say the food is about a 7, however.  As others have said, save the $15 and tour the mansion yourself.",1,positive
"I have to say the view from above was fantastic. We (my fianc\u00e9e and I)  had dinner here too so we have the night view. The food and service was great, but when you think of a pricey restaurant like this the place would be a little more quiet/ peaceful, but nope it was loud. They also don't offer substitutions as well...",1,positive
"Overrated. The place is very small maybe 4-5 tables. The service was not that good, not personable. The parking is horrendous.  To top it off the food wasnt that great. The sweet home alabama was not what I expected. Not much flavor in the different pasta dishes. Sad!",0,negative
"Known for their prime rib in the evenings, they have a wide variety of other menu items.  I should know, I've eaten lunch there on average of twice a week for 4 years now.  No wonder I'm the \""""Duke\"""".  Great rooms for private parties or presentations, one seats 47, the other seats 35 with closed doors and a nice patio when it cools off.",1,positive
Very Beautiful restaurant - that's about it.\nI didn't expect fine dining but this was tasted like overpriced tv dinners.  It used to be ok now it just falls way short of acceptable.,0,negative
"It's ok. The price was decent and it was near my meeting, but I don't think I would bring the family here.",0,negative
"Great food and wine list. Somewhat overpriced, but it'll be an excellent dining experience. The service was great, and our dinners were fantastic. Overall, the prices are not good, but the chef really knows what they're doing. If you just want the same dishes you can get at any restaurant, this is not the place. If you want an original dish, or something weird, Sage really excels.",1,positive
"Good restaurant, friendly and competent service, the food was really good.\n\nIt is an expensive restaurant, but it is worth what it costs!",1,positive
"I was only here for a networking event in the lovely room downstairs so I can't speak to the usual dining experience but in terms of a private event with passed canapes, the food was wildly hit or miss. The tartare was delicious, but the quiches were not cooked - literally runny raw egg. Gah I have the heebie jeebies again just thinking about it.\n\nBut I do want to come back and try the ceasars!",0,negative
"Very good food, wine, service and ambience.  Everyone enjoyed what they had and the prices were reasonable for the quality and portion size.  The Price Fix menu was a great value with the included salad and dessert.  They also have a fantastic selection of wines by the glass.  I particularly like how the pour your glass from the bottle at the table and allow you to taste it before the full glass.",1,positive

"This branch of Wells Fargo is my favorite.  For the most part because of a banker there named Morris Richie.  I have multilpe accounts and multiple questions.  Morris is so friendly and helpful it is unbelieveable.  No matter what banking problem I have, Morris solves it.  I feel like he is my friend rather than my banker.  When he was on vacation his manager (can not remember her name) helped me with notarizing something and she also was completely friendly and helpful.  I go out of my way to use this bank.",1,positive
No tellers. Really. Hire hire hire. Today 2 tellers. Yesterday At 4pm 1 teller. This bank really sucks. They have a greeter and plenty of personnel to open accounts and do loans. But no tellers. Really!,0,negative
Do NOT get Raechel as a teller she is slow. Painfully slow. It took her 15 minutes to do a  1500 deposit that i counted and turned. AND THEN spoke to me as if i didnt know what i was doing when i do the same thing weekly.,0,negative
"This review is only based off of one experience from a non customer. My customer paid me with a 25 dollar check from this credit union, I went here to cash it and they told me they \""""have to charge a fee of 10 dollars for non members.\""""\nUm, no. You can't honor your own customers checks than you're not a great company.",0,negative
They charge an additional fee for credit cards AND DEBIT CARDS. That isn't cool. I really like the place and have been coming for years but didn't realize they were charging extra for debit cards. Uncool.,0,negative
Would NOT use this bank.  Unknowledgeable banker didn't know her own products.\nWas a waste of time!\n\nWells Fargo I am staying with you!,0,negative
This place is one of the better cash advance places i have been too. Better rates than the competitors and the owner Dale is very willing to work with you if you are late on making a payment.  The non corporate is a major appeal!!,1,positive
What ever happen to customer service?  It seems that this term and banking (at least with Chase) are not allowed to exist within their walls  I had a deposit eaten by the ATM on Sunday march 4 and today Tuesday the Acting manager and CSR told me they only count the machine once a week on Thursdays. Kinda makes you scratch your head and go hummmm What else can I say?,0,negative

"This location is next door to the Einsteins near UNLV. \n\nI really like it at this branch, better service experience here than at any other locations I go to. \n\nStaff are friendly, efficient and helpful which is exactly what you need at a bank - after all, they're handling YOUR MONEY!\n\nI tend to hold off going to the bank if I'm in my side of town until a day I'm over near this location because I know I will be in and out quickly having been provided good service.",1,positive

"I've never gone inside this branch, but regularly use the ATMs because the location is close to where I often am anyway.  However, it's a real pain to get in and out of the place due to the way it's situated on the corner.  If traffic is heavy, forget it.  I only use this location if I'm not going to be driving by another one.",0,negative
"Worst customer service. I opened an account online and went to the branch to make the initial deposit. They don't know what their online banking system is doing and they had to send it to another location in Tucson, this is after I had called yesterday to verify that I could make the initial deposit in my local branch. Get it together! If you are going to have an online system, make sure the branch operations coincide with that! I'm going to cancel my account and do my business elsewhere. Thanks for the headache!",0,negative

"I do my banking at the Nellis AFB branch (for over 3 years now) & have always been treated well there. Linda, Arlene, Michelle & pretty much all the reps have always been friendly & helpful. They even greet me by my first name & remember my boyfriend's name (also a member now), even though he doesn't have to go in that often & ask how we are all doing. Coming from a small town, it's nice to have that small town atmosphere in a city like this.",1,positive

Just my opinion.",0,negative
Nobody greeted me when I entered the bank. There was a black girl who just looked at me and say nothing. The employees are not friendly and helpful.,0,negative

Very rude staff. Sandra at the cashier doesn't want ppl to pay with cash because she doesn't want to count change. So she decided to cuss my wife out for paying with a $20 and some coins. \n\nAvoid this business.

This is a good location for me on occassion. At times i need to pop in and make a deposit or withdrawl.

"I'll be honest, I hate going to the bank. Totally hate it. But as far as banks go, this place is top notch. The staff is professional and courteous. The service is always a step above. If you have to bank (and we all do), you might as well bank here.",1,positive
"Attempted to check this place out tonight because I heard it was good. I'm on travel for business and my company gave me an American Express card for all my expenses. Well after driving down here and just getting ready to order, I ask to make sure they accept Amex and sure enough they don't. Also they don't accept discover cards either so I left. They didn't seem to care.",0,negative
Never dealt with a more unprofessional company. I had my car booted and was told to walk to an ATM bc they couldn't take a card. The driver literally made a finger walking signal and told me hit the pavement. He used profanity. What an awful human being.,0,negative
They do not accept credit cards without a chip.  They send you to an ATM.,0,negative

Long wait for a banker at 9:30 in the morning. There are almost no customers here. But no available bankers as well. There are no greeters to help incoming people as in other WF branches.,0,negative
Worst credit union ever. Started charging $8.00 per day for no money in account then made up creative ways of making sure you have a zero balance! Didn't bother to inform customers of $8.00 charge but swear up and down they did so via email. Typical Vegas BS.,0,negative
This place is one of the better cash advance places i have been too. Better rates than the competitors and the owner Dale is very willing to work with you if you are late on making a payment.  The non corporate is a major appeal!!,1,positive
Tellers here are great. \nThey don't bombard me with the usual sales pitches.\n\nPersonal bankers are awesome about account issues and super friendly. \nI truly feel like they present solutions and not just sales. \n\nThis is my favorite branch.,1,positive
I have been coming to this location quite a bit and never had an issue. I went today and they refused to take my Discover card because they don't accept it even though I have never had a problem in the past. AVOID THIS LOCATION IF YOU USE DISCOVER!,0,negative

"It's not the people, but how the bank itself runs that pisses me off. The fees, the red tape, the general BS I seem to have problems with these buttheads. I have three (3) business accounts here and they tell me time \n-and-again that I need to open a personal account to cash my paycheck with them. I own my business, the check is from them BofA, it's made out to me. F***ers give me my money, it's mine NOT yours.",0,negative

"Twenty years ago Silver State Schools Credit Union was a customer-friendly community business. Now it uses every sleazy trick that Big Banking uses to rip of their customers. .

"This Wells Fargo is right behind my house, but never seems to fail me with their drive thru ATM! It's always down or cash is unavailable! It's a huge inconvenience! Why offer a drive up ATM if it's never working for cash!!! This needs to be fixed!",0,negative
Would have tried it if they didn't only accept cash as payment.,0,negative
Just went to this location and they are charging a fee for using debit cards. An additional 39 cent fee on top of the price of food. That's a cost of doing business.  I will never go to this location again.,0,negative
Service is slow. Waiting over 20 minutes to see a banker.,0,negative
My money was stolen on multiple occasions right out of my account.  They replaced it but geez then it would happen again.  I had to quit using that acct all together.  I still get emails years later now that say you just logged into your account.  What?  WTF??  No I didnt.,0,negative
"I've been a Chase customer for nearly 20 years and have several accounts, both personal and business. Today for my business I tried to draw $1000 in ones and the branch was completely unaccommodating.  I expect money to be available to enable my business.  That was not the case today.",0,negative
This is a good location for me on occassion. At times i need to pop in and make a deposit or withdrawl. Lots of parking in the lot and you can access it from Thomas or 7th Ave.  They are very friendly and try to help you as quick as they can. They also have a drive thru. but at times i find it is quicker just to go inside.,1,positive
"I've had some terrible experiences with banks in the past and when I relocated to Las Vegas I wasn't sure which to choose. But I'm really glad I did pick this branch, I have had to do a ton of things through this bank and everyone I have dealt with has gone above and beyond to help me. Rough location to get out of, Rainbow is usually a mess right there.",1,positive

"Slowest tellers and they are all pretty rude and pretend they don't know anything.\n\nAlso, do not do anything at the branch. Call and speak to someone at corporate or your account will be thoroughly mucked up!",0,negative
"What can I say, I HATE Chase.  They care about no one but themselves.  I only stopped as this is the bank that the account is based from.  Since I have no choice in this matter I use Chase, but for my personal banking, I'll stay as far away from Chase as I can.",0,negative
I have been a loyal customer for 14 years and was shocked to look at my accounts and see $87 if fees. I have a checking account that I thought met all the requirements for free checking and was hit with $87 in charges. I will be closing all my accounts. It's a shame as the staff at this branch is helpful and really nice.,0,negative
"I don't bank at Chase.  But my brother does.  He needed to go the bank, and this branch was the closest one he found from strip.  So, as an convenience, this is the place to head for Chase customers.  Problem is that the line moved slow and the parking was not so good.",0,negative
It's interesting to know that if your money is not accepted by their checkout machines they will not personally accept it at all if the bill should fail to work.  Idiots.  Left a cart full of groceries at the check out as I walked out. Lost a customer and a sale.,0,negative
"Very dangerous to use ATM at night!  It's located  on the back of the building with a brick wall  on your right, completely hiding from view.  Safer to drive to the one on Las Vegas Blvd and Clark, very open and lit up like the 4th of July.",0,negative
My experience with Foreign Money Exchange was good. I asked $500.00 or the closest to that amount so as not to get a weird amount. They gave me pesos. Really easy and professional. Not rude at all.\nPretty good rate to boot.,1,positive
Its what you expect of a Military bank. Friendly employees and no lines. They helped me get cash and i was on my way rather quickly.,1,positive
"Parking is never a problem; lines can be long but lots of teller windows open, and business banking line is quick.\n\nSpecial shout-out to Jennifer Bagget, who is absolutely lovely and helpful.  She took care of all of the business banking needs I had, always remembered me by name and all of the business account details, and was extremely responsive -- just terrific!",1,positive
"I am a business customer and as such the business teller is NEVER open and when the sign is not up they take customers from the business line. Once I stood in the business line for 10 mins, while the regular line filled up with other customers, THEN they tell me there was no business teller that day. So I had to get at the back of the line and waited 20 mins. Uncalled for!",0,negative
Don't waste your time! They charge outlandish fees! They told us that if we brought our paychecks in to get verified then they could deposit it same day instead of having to wait. Guess what?!? They can't do that and you have to wait four days! I have used credit unions all over the US and never heard of anything as stupid as this credit union. We will definitely NEVER be back!\n\nthey talked us into staying last time but this is it! We are done here!,0,negative
Love this branch! Every time I have had an issue with  my account or needed some questions answered I have always gotten assistance quickly. Last time I was in I even had the branch manager help me.

"Great bank, super friendly staff and, well, there's always candy LOL. Can't beat that.",1,positive
"I only use the ATM at this branch. I have had bankers open accounts in the past without my knowledge and when I asked for the District Managers phone number, I was given an assistants name and number under the impression that she was the DM.  I understand bankers need to make their numbers but opening accounts without a customers consent so that you can make your \""""numbers\"""" is illegal.",0,negative
"Do not let the name change from WAMU to Chase fool you, your money is not safe with Chase.

"I've been coming to this bank for years... never thought to write a review until now. The atm is great and I suppose the only time it wouldn't be is if it were empty. The tellers are rude, the managers are rude and it takes so long to do anything there! If it wasn't for my Wells Fargo accounts that I really like,  I would not bank here. I've never expected much being a bank and all but a smile and hello go a long way.",0,negative
"The tellers at this bank, although friendly, are not very competent. They do not pay attention to anything you write on the check, like the account number on the back. I wish I could find a bank that actually cares about my business.",0,negative
I have come to this location four separate times to set up an account. After being sent away for not having made an appointment the second time I should have learned my lesson but I was told most days I wouldn't need one.

"When I lived nearby, I would visit this location often.  Now, I rarely stop by this location, but happened to be in the area recently.  The tellers here are always friendly and the service is quick.....those are 2 of my biggest requirements for a bank (Fast & Friendly).\n\nReturn Factor - 50%....would be higher if I lived nearby.",1,positive
Why would chase assign a personal banker for location I've never been too?? They asked me to come in to meet my personal banker. I get to the bank at 5 like I was asked. For my personal banker to tell me I have the right accounts. I'm not sure what I was expecting but thanks Chase for wasting my time.,0,negative
I have not been super impressed lately with service.  One deposit at the window - now takes 10 minutes.  When the last bank manager was there - it was NOT this way.  They have not hired appropriate personnel.,0,negative
i normally really like this bank. every time i go in there is no one in there so i never have to wait. so as far as banks go i really like it its quick and easy to pay my bills.,1,positive
"SAD NEWS. Chase no longer lets others put any amount of cash into another's account. That means, my business partner can't deposit to my account, nor can I deposit $100 to my step-daughters account if she needs some money. THIS IS A TERRIBLE POLICY. Speaking with the manager, this comes from the top. There is no work-arounds. Even with ID, only the account holder may deposit CASH to their account. TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE from the TOP MANAGEMENT, I have only compliments for the local branch Manager.",0,negative
"This branch is so slow, especially around 10 am to 2 pm.  Always seems to have 10 employees but only 3 windows open.  Random employees walking around saying \""""thanks for coming in today\"""" \""""how's your day going\"""". My day was going well until I came in.  I recommend using the atm for every possible thing that  the atm dose, instead of going inside.",0,negative
This Bank of America is terrible. I get my check that is made out to Bank of America and they charge me a fee of $6 just to cash it but at the other Bank of America on Pecos they don't charge me.,0,negative
"BOYCOTT this branch!\nI absolutely despise this in-store'so called bank' that lacks any customer service skills. Yes I'm here once a day, but if I could find another location that's open after five to drop my deposits I would jump at the chance. I would like to rant about this place, but it's a complete waste of my time.\n\n*** I WILL NO LONGER ever use these buttheads and WILL BE moving my accounts now to another bank. If you walk into this place, go ahead and get your \""""SUCKER\"""" tattoo to your forehead.",0,negative
"They're not exactly a model of kind or friendly customer service.\n\nThey rejected me for a checking account. That isn't a problem, it's how they treated me after I was told; like \""""It's time for you to go\"""".\n\nA modicum of decency would have been nice, not getting shuffled out the door.",0,negative
Would NOT use this bank.  Unknowledgeable banker didn't know her own products.\nWas a waste of time!\n\nWells Fargo I am staying with you!,0,negative
"This bank has the slowest most incompetent staff, all I wanted was a money order this process took them about 30 minutes to execute. I would rather drive across town to a branch who can execute simple tasks efficiently and promptly. You would think since they are so busy they would hire more competent people! So frustrating!",0,negative
"What an awful bank. To simply cash a check, you have to wait over 20 minutes for the desk clerk to verify funds and get FINGERPRINTED. Next, you have to wait 10 minutes more through the teller line, only to get treated like a criminal. On top of that, you get to pay them a $7.50 fee for the privilege of going through all that hell.",0,negative
"They were early and went straight to work. My weeds were very high due to other services not showing up, but they finished and cleaned my over grown yard in an hour!  This includes trimming several bushes.  I will continue to use them until they give me a reason not to, but I've never seen a group of people work so fast.",1,positive
We had a great experience with Addison Landscapes. They transformed our backyard into a beautiful tranquil space. Joe Fraser and all of the workers were very professional. I would highly recommend them.,1,positive

Phoenix Rattlesnake Solutions is the Best way to get ride from snake in your House.\nThey have a great experience. I am highly impressed at their work ability.

They solve my problem very quickly. If i face this kinds of problem in the future then without feeling any hesitation I will contact with them.,1,positive
"Highly recommend!  Marty was great to work with and we are very pleased with our fence. When Marty came for the quote he spent time going over the product and different configuration options for the pool fence with our yard layout, and then gave us a very no-pressure quote. We decided right away to go with Marty and don't regret it. We also recommended him to some friends who just bought a new house and they are very happy as well.",1,positive
"Couldn't imagine having used anyone else to install our pool fence. Marty scheduled the appointments himself, was always on-time, and gave us the best price of the companies we spoke with.

We've already recommended him to a couple of friends!",1,positive
"I would not use this company. Used them while we went on vacation. When we returned our pool was green. I don't even know if they came at all. I would say that if you do use them I would make sure they come when you are home, so you can watch them clean your pool!",0,negative

"HORRIBLE customer service!! I called Elite because my property management recommended them. When I called to set up an appointment, she asked if I wanted to set up monthly spraying.

BEWARE!!!!! The owners are not very nice if you tell them something is wrong. They didn't like that we brought back bales of hay that had A LOT of rock and dirt in it.

Prior to AMS, I would have to cally landscaper (went through a bunch) incessantly just to get th out (almost like they were doing ME a favor by coming to my house). \n\nI found AMS on YELP, and have been working with Eli.

Even the payment is done electronically. \n\n I love these guys, highly recommend them.",1,positive

I'll stick with A&P on Ironwood.",0,negative

Good job.\nI would definitely use them again.,1,positive

The service we received from Arborscape was incredible. The company sent out a certified arborist to discuss our tree issues. He was very knowledgeable and spent time explaining what pruning and plant health care programs would be best for our yard.\n\nThe crew that trimmed our trees was very professional. They made sure not to damage any other landscaping and cleaned up after they were done. Our yard was cleaner after they left than it was when they arrived.\n\nI will gladly use Arborscape again.,1,positive

Never had issues with any of their people in the field either, whether replacing my filter or troubleshooting my wiring.",1,positive
"Unhelpful. Called to ask if they worked on splash pads, said no. Asked if he knew someone that did, he said no. He then said call a pond company.

He said no, it's an accessory water feature, call a fountain company. \n\nOne would think with 40 years he might know something. Considering splash pads are popping up all over Phoenix.",0,negative

All I have to say is wow\nI called to see if I can get a quote for my green pool. Instead I reach Dan who was very helpful. He walked me through what I would need and how to do it. He explained to me the product I was using wasn't working and he even offered me I call him back if I needed help.

Four years later it still looks perfect and it was the only fair price we had. I just looked them up on Yelp  because I need a new yard renovated and decided to add my review.",1,positive
Great service. Would definitely refer this contractor to others. Very professional and great work. Affordable and very friendly :) only person I will trust with my yard,1,positive
"Used this place before and was satisfied with there service for septic wait removal. 7 years later we call to use them again and they charged us twice as much as last time and spent less time draining the septic tank and he was rude and seem to be in a hurry to get on out of there, and we didn't feel like they did not do a good and quality job. 6 month later its full again. And won't help us out with this bad service they did for us.  Would never recommend to anyone find a better company to do business with.",0,negative
I have been using Magic Pest Control for 3 years and have never had a problem with them. They have done a termite treatment and have been doing routine pest control services.  If for some reason the bugs are still there they will come do a free retreat. \nSebastian is an awesome tech. \nGreat company.,1,positive
"We found a roach in our bathroom and decided to call an exterminator. We read great reviews about Insectek. We called them around 3pm and had someone out before 5pm that same day! The exterminator Zack was punctual, friendly and very knowledgeable. We are new to Arizona and he shared some great information with us about bugs, scorpions etc...We will definitely be calling him back in the future and recommend him to anyone with pest problems. Great service all around!",1,positive
I have used AMS Landscaping for probably close to 3 years now. They are very dependable and reliable. I find their rates to be very competitive and always do a good job. I have consulted with Eli on numerous projects and he is a wealth of information. I would highly recommend AMS to anyone searching for the services they provide.,1,positive
"Absolutely terrible communication, very inconsistent.  Turned my pool green 3 times and each time I reported it, they never sent anyone out, I had to take care of it myself.  They have one technician that did a good job, but overall, it was a horrible experience.  Never gave me a quote to fix anything even though they mentioned a few things may not be working.  Would never recommend this company to anyone.",0,negative
Stop looking- you found your Sprinkler guys!  They even have a landscaping division called Yard Doctors.  I was so happy with their FAST and professional service that I switched to their landscaping too.  I have yet to be disappointed.,1,positive
Good but very pricy!!! Not worth the cost. Family of 4 30 bucks!!  Plus there wasnt even enough. After the small cups were done the kids wanted more. Maybe thats what the owner has planned. Really!! U can take family of 4 to a Resturant and get desert for the same price. I miss Cold Stone. The employees were awesome tho!,0,negative
Way too overpriced and nothing special with the atomosphire. Foods are Okey and presentation is good but nothing authentic by any means.,0,negative

Overall good value. Vegas style. But no vegetables. Well except for fries. Still. Would go again.,1,positive

"Pricy, but not so much compared to other things on the Strip, and it tasted pretty good.",1,positive
"Overpriced. All the 3 entrees we got tasted like oversalted mush. I've eaten at many veggie restaurants, I expected far more creativity with spices. If the raw lifestyle means uncooked, barely seasoned food, I guess this is your place. You're better off with the  Veggie Delight  on Wynn road or Long life veggie on Sandhill, right off Flamingo.",0,negative

"Very cheap for excellent quality.\n\nSpecifically pointed out and said the name of what I wanted, received something else, was still delicious which was the purpose in coming inside anyways, so no worries.\n\nStill unpleasant talking with (what I assumed to be the owner, seemed like I was bothering him.\n\nAlthough on the good side. Very pleasant little shop in the middle of a not so pleasant area, all in all was nice experience. Will be back. Mostly because of how good everything was.",1,positive
"Incredibly cheap, about $7 for very generous portions. Taste was good.",1,positive
"OK but not definitely worth returning.. The broth did not have the home made authentic taste to it. Feels Fake. It is given as diluted a lot.

"For $35/person but no olysters or sahimi?  No way!  It's just not worth it.  I dont understand why it's rated four stars.  If you put aside the dessert, it's a $15 buffet top.   For same price, I'd rather go to Todai at Planet Hollywood.",0,negative
Pricey for what you get. Pretty good flavor. Service was ok. I'd say go to Elmer's right down the street instead.,0,negative
Good value for on-the-go option. I just tried the beef one and I don't think it's their specialty. Other stuff would be better.,1,positive

"Very pricey, but good.  Not worth the price, unless for a special occasion.  I like that they are local, but have not had the greatest service.  Also, the K9 Custard should be on the menu and not just on the sliding glass door when you already order.  Good to check out once, but not often.",0,negative

Barro's pizza is super good. I go to Barro's almost once everyday and get their Honey BBQ traditional wings. I would highly recommend it. The chicken that's used is really good the sauce is divine. I love Buffalo Wild Wings but for the price and the size of the wings I recommend Barro's. Plus the waiters and waitresses have been SUPER awesome! Great customer service there is a reason I keep coming back and giving them my business.,1,positive
"Casual and tasty, Villa Dolce wins big with me for their Euro-style pizza. The service is quick and friendly, although expect to wait a bit on the busy nights.

Luckily, they sell it by the jar so I can take a little of their Italian magic home with me. :)",1,positive

"Best pizza in CU right now. It's local, has great crust, fresh yummy toppings, lots of vegetarian choices, and is a great deal. Limited hours of operation and no sitting or delivery are drawbacks, but it's a great location so it's pretty easy to stop by and pick up your pizza, and they are ready quite quickly after ordering.",1,positive

I went in for the first time a couple days ago, and the staff was extremely nice. I ordered a Pan Pizza to go and it was fantastic. My dad heated up the leftovers the next day and said it was the \""""best next day heated up pizza\"""" he ever ate. Love it!!!",1,positive

"Bonannos was closed (along with the rest of the food court in The Flamingo, for constructon) so we tried this place across from the flamingo habitat. Ordered a whole pepperoni pie, took no more than 10 minutes, came out hot, fresh and pretty good. Well priced,  speedy, served beer and was open during a buzzed pizza craving at 7AM",1,positive
This place is amazing.  The slice of pizza that you get for their meal deals is huge and is sure to fill you up.  I would recommend that everyone try Jimmy & Joe's as it is a great slice of pizza and the people are really nice.  You never have to wait to long and Amy is very sweet and welcoming.,1,positive
Moved to Chicago 6 months ago. I am in desperate need to find pizza like Napoli's has! I can't find it! This place has great pizza and wings - I miss it. I think I am going to cry.....,1,positive
"I'm pretty picky when it comes to pizza and there are only a few places in Pittsburgh that I'll go. The staff is great, the location is on my way home from work, and the pizza is made hot and fresh to order. The staff alone is enough to keep me coming back, but I love the food too. \n\nI personally love the buffalo chicken roll bites. I have yet to have a pizza from here that I don't like. I love their chewy, yet crispy crust and their toppings are pretty tasty as well.",1,positive
Red Devil has some of the best pizza in town. The crust is deliciously salty and the sauce has plenty of flavor. Wings aren't half bad either,1,positive
"I ordered Pesaro's last week and it was great. I know a lot of other people have had bad experiences, but I really loved it. We got a large pizza with black olives and extra cheese. It was cooked perfectly, delicious and it got here in a reasonable amount of time with no problems. I'll try it again soon and hope that my opinion doesn't change!!",1,positive

Pizza here rocks. Their chicken Frances is fantastic. The housewine one of the best I've ever had. And I'm 100% Italian... you know what I mean!,1,positive
"Mineo's in Squirell Hill has the best pizza in all of Pittsburgh! The slices have lots of gooey cheese and it's over 50 years old. It is relatively expensive, but I feel that the food is worth the price, and I like to help out a local business. The best thing to order: a plain pizza. Make sure to grab extra napkins :)",1,positive
"I don't know why anyone would ever use Domino's after eating a slice of Venezia's! Their sauce is out of this world and so tasty, as is their crust. You can tell they make it by hand everyday.\n\nAnd their lunch specials (and they also have daily specials) are just the right size. I had a slice of pizza and a small salad for less than $7.00.\n\nThe Tempe location is large inside, but around lunchtime it is really busy! We got one of the last tables. Venezia's is a definite must for pizza in Phoenix.",1,positive
Hawthorne's has the best pizza in Charlotte. The quality of ingredients is great and you don't feel sick after stuffing your face with this pizza. I have tried just about every pizza place there is to try in Charlotte and this is the ONLY place worth eating!\n\nThe only reason I did not give this place 5 stars is that I only recommend it for take out. The pizza tastes better in take out than when you eat in. The atmosphere and the service inside the restaurant leaves something to be desired.,1,positive
"Best pizza restaurant in green valley. I wish they offered delivery but for pizza this good we can pick up! They don't have pepperoni but they have something very similar just ask. All pizzas are 12\"""" so get 2 for 3-4 people. For myself and 2 kids we usually get 2 and have a little left over. Highly recommend this place!",1,positive
I grew up eating Ray's Pizza at 59th/Greenway.  I find the pizza at Napoli to be quite similar if not exactly the same.  I think Napoli does the crust better.  Wings are good too.,1,positive
Good za!!' Apart from the franchise pizza this is a better alternative.  The wings are great too,1,positive
"Went out to this pizza joint with my swim team hoping for decent pizza. I was incredibly happy to find that the pizza was delicious. I ordered the signature pan pizza with pepperoni. It was everything you love about Chicago-style deep dish pizza down in Champaign. \n\nUnfortunately, the meal takes a long time to be served. We sat down at 4:40 and didn't get out good until 5:45 rolled around. \n\nQuickie review: Go here whenever you can! Food-wise Papa Del's is some of the best Champaign can offer.",1,positive
Love this place. Takeout special cheese pizza is a great deal and they have the best ranch dressing.,1,positive
Finally tried Hawthorne's last week after waiting a couple of years post-Mellow Mushroom.  Yawn -- really nondescript taste (though a couple of the topping combinations were quite interesting -- including pulled pork on their take on the Hawaiian pizza -- nicely done!).\n\nNo reason to pick this place when Brooklyn's is just over at Rea and Colony.,0,negative
"Okay so we decided to give good ol' Long Wongs another shot. After we were in there meeting friends for a drink, we saw a couple of their pizza's and they looked ...awesome. We decided to go back a couple days later to pick up a pizza. It was actually one of the better pizza's I have had recently. We've been back several times over the last two months and haven't had a bad meal yet.",1,positive
"Any place that offers gluten free options gets my vote and my business.\n\nBut I was incredibly surprised that a BAR has a GLUTEN FREE and HEALTHY menu.  Whaaaa?!!!!  Awesome!\n\nThey are really friendly here, too.  So that helps. The GF pizza is delicious!",1,positive
"To be fair, I do know the folks that run this place.  BUT -- I would love Manolo's anyway.  I think they have a creative menu -- not standard ingredients in their empanadas and pizza.  Very large pizza slices, and they always make it fresh.  You can buy their stuff when you are in the Canopy Club, too.  I've turned several people on to this place and I truly miss it now that I'm gone.  I think it is really affordable and a nice change to the usual pizza and campus food scene.",1,positive

"Let me just say that the Parmesan Chicken Sub from Pizza Extreme is AMAZING!!! I love that thing, and have gotten it there off and on for years.  I just am giving this a 2 star rating because the last two times in a row I've been to the Fish Hatchery location, I've gotten terrible customer service (though in fairness, it's always from the same person).  The Raymond Rd location I've had exceptional service from, and the food is all the same (yummy!)",0,negative
Big shout out to Boston Pizza!!  Eleni and has a kick ass crew. The Best Pizza specials and the wings are the best. My partner and I work for the RTC and we visit frequently for the Outstanding food. Again those killer wings and the best ranch.. We will see you soon Eleni.. Go Steelers..\nThanks Tony,1,positive
"Friday night/ Pizza night wouldn't be the same without Red Devil.  We love their pizza, love their wings and love the exceptional service that we always receive.  Especially at such a reasonable price.",1,positive
I ate Rosatis when I lived in Chicago. Great pizza and their bottled giardiniera is fantastic.,1,positive
"Can't find Boston Pizza Guelph so I will write it here. NOT GOOD. My son had the beef dip last year and came down quite ill for a few days. Emails to their manager over a couple days only came back with a strong defence over their quality control, without even bothering go ask how my son was doing. I will NOT go back to a Boston Pizza, besides East Side Mario's offers more reasonable food with substantially bigger portions! ..we eat out frequently.",0,negative
We have been eating at Jo Jo's for 7 years. By far one if the best Pizza's in the Phoenix area. We usually do take out and if its late a delivery they never disappoint!,1,positive
"Venezia's has terrific pizza.  period.  locally owned and operated by a family who really cares about their customers.   It's all we eat anymore when it comes to pizza.  it's close, delivery is fast and the pizza is great.  an impressive list of ingrediants like spinach, artichoke hearts, and other stuff you don't usually get in a chain pizzaria makes it easy to customize your pie to your specifications.  you can also order online! two greasy thumbs up!",1,positive
Finally tried Hawthorne's last week after waiting a couple of years post-Mellow Mushroom.  Yawn -- really nondescript taste (though a couple of the topping combinations were quite interesting -- including pulled pork on their take on the Hawaiian pizza -- nicely done!).\n\nNo reason to pick this place when Brooklyn's is just over at Rea and Colony.,0,negative
I was a bit in a rush visiting this place so i just tried the pizza called Pomo. That was sick!!! Cant wait to go there again and try something more. Service was great.,1,positive
"YUM! I was trying to think of something different for lunch. Sometimes, I get tired of the Estrella Parkway choices...Then, I remembered this little gem. The food is so yummy. (Got the veggie pizza). The veggies are fresh, they cook the pizza to order and the service is friendly and prompt.\nPrices aren't bad either!",1,positive
"Ahh! A taste of Chicago right here at home. I've tried all the places that claim to be Chicago style, and before, only Amore Pizza was a true fit. Windy City is also the real deal. They do combos and dogs just like back home on the south side. They even have pizza puffs and tom tom tamales. Only their fries are better than any I had in Chicago, crispy and fluffy on the inside, slighty salty, just perfect with ketchup. Looks like we'll be regulars.",1,positive
Love Euro Pizza.  Their Dr. Oz Veggies are so good.  We've also had pizza which is great too.  They have indoor/outdoor seating which is great.  Also the best view of the fountain on the patio.  When very busy we have had a slight delay in getting served but then have received food very timely.  Would recommend for sure!,1,positive
Ate here in August. We Always stay at Aria. Got the pepperoni & house sausage pizza. We were surprised the crust was chewy after being cooked in a wood-fired oven & the toppings were quite greasy. Really a let down for the place & price!!!,0,negative
"NYPD is the old standby.  Always consistent always good.  I recently had the Italian beef salad.  It was different, but good.  The wings, salads, meatballs and most importantly pizza are all good as well.  The service is always good.\n\nWe have been going to NYPD since they opened their first restaurant on Via Linda ( it is now something else) .\n\nYou will never go wrong at NYPD.",1,positive
"Been ordering from Sardella's for years. Long before yelp was but a whisper.\nGreat pizza and wings. I think I have only been let down once, but I even question my memory on that.\nEverything always arrives hot when I order delivery.",1,positive

"I love Pizza Sola. Next to Pasqualino's in Penn Hills, it's one of my favorite pizza shops in the area. The slices are huge, the people are friendly, and the cost and variety is great. Really don't know what's not to like.",1,positive
Best pizza in town. That's a tough title to earn with Jimmy and Joes right down the street.,1,positive
Excellent pizza! \n\nI was in there two weeks ago and the owner recommended the Philly in a wrap version. I have never heard of it in a wrap version so I ordered it and I now know what I'll order every time I go it there.,1,positive
"Awesome Clark Street Meat pizza with wonderful dinner salads to accompany it.  Ask for Taylor to serve you. She is as good a waitress as the food is. You won't leave disappointed. Like Arnold says, \""""I'll be back.\""""",1,positive
"As a recent Chicago transplant, I've really been missing Chicago pizza. Imagine my amazement when I discovered that there was an Uno's in Madison! \n\nWrong. While the original Pizzaria Uno (at Ohio and Wabash) is wonderful, something is lost in translation here. I can't even explain it. It's just bad. \n\nThe hunt for good deep dish in Madison continues...",0,negative

"I love Rigitony's. They have good, homemade pastas. They have great lunch specials. Its affordable and fresh. I have not had the pizza. My favorite is the baked spaghetti and meatballs. Fresh and chunky marinara is amazing. I would take this place over most major italian places.",1,positive
Love the Buffalo Chicken Pizza! I don't recall ever having anything that I didn't like at this restaurant though!,1,positive
"Bucks is my favorite pizza place in town.  To like Bucks you must like Racine style pizza(thiiiiinnnnn crust and cheap).  I like that Bucks dosent waste their money on niceties like pizza boxes, delivery, or operating out of somewhere other than an old defunct car wash. they focus on their pizza instead, and they do pizza very well.",1,positive
"Stopped here on a Sunday evening for a quick bite to go.  This place is a little divey, but Sal makes it worth the trip.  I am giving 5 stars because the pizza was damn good and Sal.  He was friendly and comical and he puts out a great product.  We had the pepperoni and sausage pizza and the lasagna pizza.  Both were extremely satisfying.  So if you are in the South Side and looking for a late bite of pizza, hit up Sal's.  He's open and you won't be disappointed.",1,positive
"Talk about pizza with character! We came to Johnnie's for dinner and got one extra-large pizza. Their crust was just right, not too thick and doughy like some other places. Best of all was their ultra-specific time at which the pizza would be ready: 6:52 pm. Nice. \n\nThe people working there were very friendly. It's definitely not as cheap as some deals you'd find at national pizza chains, but this pizza had so much more flavor and character. Check them out!",1,positive
"I love Maestro's Pizza, I told my friends about this place and they all like to get their pizza from here if they are in the area. The Spicy Mexican Pizza is my favorite, its got a perfect amount of spice to it and its crazy flavorful!! Every pizza Ive had has been good and Ive had like 5 different ones.",1,positive
"We've been looking for a good pizza place for a while. Rosatis is SO good. I mean really, I\""""m so glad we finally found decent pizza. Tried most of their menu, all very good",1,positive
"Hawthorne's is great! I would definitely recommend dining in instead of takeout because their food is really only good when you eat in. I have tried a lot of their specialty pizzas and basically everyone of them is good, I really like the pesto pizza. They also have great salads, appetizers, and sandwiches. The atmosphere is cool and the service is also great. It's also a really good place for groups of people!",1,positive
Square Pizza is a great Pittsburgh area thing that alot of people just don't understand Beto's is new to me there is Tons of Cheese and Pepperoni and great Sauce very generous with toppings a little expensive but well worth it.  If you like this pizza try Osso's in Washington PA.,1,positive
Best pizza in Pitt I've had although occasionally not great. But always fast. They'd be an even greater hit if they delivered.,1,positive
I grew up eating Ray's Pizza at 59th/Greenway.  I find the pizza at Napoli to be quite similar if not exactly the same.  I think Napoli does the crust better.  Wings are good too.,1,positive
Good pizza and specials,1,positive
great new york style pizza. super friendly & fast. dine-in is a little iffy but food is good. pricy=large delivered with wings @$40,1,positive
"We need to come here more often. I say that each time I go but somehow end up at Gilbert Pizza when the mood strikes. The thing that sets Nincantonis's apart is the fabulous super thin but crispy crust. A pizza is only as good as the gravy (sauce) and that too excels. I appreciate the sausage is the real deal and not frozen bullets like some pizza joints.\n\nYeah, we need to come here more often.",1,positive
"With Gumby's closed it was hard to find good pizza in the CU area. Drew's definitely fills the Gumby gap. It reminds me of my favorite place in Chicago, Piece. The pizza is extra cheesy, and the crust actually tastes like it was made -- not picked up out of cardboard box in the back of a warehouse freezer. Drew's is definitely my go to from now on.",1,positive
"Favorite casual pizza place! I always get the pesto chicken slice and a Greek salad. The pizza is great if you like the New York style where it's thin but not so crispy that it doesn't flop down. Salads are fresh, I've had the wings as well and they're okay but you definitely come here for the pizza. Never had a bad experience at Venezia's and I've been to the Chandler and Tempe locations as well.",1,positive
"My friend's and I have been going to Enzo's since we were in highschool.  Now, 15 years later, it is still my go to pizza joint.  Weather getting a basic pizza, or manacotti, stuffed shells, lasagna, whatever!  Everything is delicious.  I dream about their garlic knots for weeks.  Can't say enough good things about this place.  Definitely two thumbs up!",1,positive
I tried Amore's Pizza and Wings and I enjoyed it. Perfect little spot for lunch or a quick dinner with the kids. I haven't yet had the pizza but we are a huge fan of their meatball subs. Delish.\n\nThe chocolate cake is also good once it hits room temperature. Yummy.,1,positive
"Chicago style deepdish was great. I don't know how true to the original their pizza is as I have never been to Chicago, but I thought it tasted fantastic. What an unlikely place to find it too. The beer was quite nice. I have had quite a few IPAs and consider myself somewhat of an aficionado and theirs definitely stood out.  Deff",1,positive
"Of the top pizza delivery chains, Papa John's takes it. I have worked as a delivery driver for a Papa Johns in the past, and though I hated the one I worked at. They really do have the freshest ingredients and their dough is fresh and is not frozen like pizza hut (also worked there). They are usually on the longer side when it comes to delivery times but its worth the extra weight for its freshness. They also use heated delivery pouches so the pizza is always super hot when it is delivered.",1,positive
I have been here on and off for years.  I am always a fan of the sician pizza.  YUM!  Love the thin crust.  The service is always good.,1,positive
"Stayed at Aria and decided to have dinner at this place since I've seen plenty great reviews on Yelp.  Needless to say, our Yelpers are right on the money.  This place, not only has great service and attentive servers, they also have really great pizza!  Ordered the GOTHAM.  Didn't disappoint.  Had cravings for it the next day. Yummy.",1,positive
"The Chipotle of pizza's pretty much! You go in and you get to choose whatever sauces, cheeses, and toppings you want, all for the same price and they bake it within 5 minutes. The girl working there, Ariana,  was really nice and very helpful. I think I gave her a hard time because I had no idea what I wanted, but still very nice. Overall, great food, chill atmosphere, nice people.",1,positive
"I've been a big fan of Hawthornes Pizza for a while now and was glad to see a location open up closer to home. Great location with convenient parking. The restaurant has a warm cozy feel with high ceilings and a decent sized bar. My favorite is still The Crew pizza and this location did it right, as usual. My kids love that the Pizza Chef will give them dough to play with as we wait for the food. Look forward to coming back soon!",1,positive
"Dinette is a beautiful little place, surprisingly so for what is essentially a mall location. Lots of natural light and great western exposure, providing a nice, warm ambiance. Their pizzas are good as well, nicely crisped thin crust and good quality ingredients. The menu changes frequently, but the seasonal roasted corn and zucchini pizza was very good. The simpler ricotta pizza was also good, although it would been improved by chopping the basil. Overall a nice place, although the price point is a little steep.",1,positive

"Jamie's is fantastic! Pretty fast, locally owned, and really cheap. Their calzones are huge and delicious, and the same goes for their pizzas! They've messed up my order once or twice, but they're really nice about fixing it and giving me the messed-up order for free. Highly recommend it!",1,positive
"Being from Chicago, I love trying local Pizza companies that serve Chicago Style Pizza. Oregano's recently opened another restaurant on Bell Road in Glendale and I could not be happier. I went in for the first time a couple days ago, and the staff was extremely nice. I ordered a Pan Pizza to go and it was fantastic. My dad heated up the leftovers the next day and said it was the \""""best next day heated up pizza\"""" he ever ate. Love it!!!",1,positive
"The best pizza in Avondale/Goodyear, bar none. They occasionally go overboard on toppings, but who is complaining?  The Greek and Fat Hawaiian specialty pizzas are great. The wings are good, too. Try the 9-1-1 wings if you like heat. The service is generally attentive. Rob is the best wait person.  PBR bottle specials are a plus.",1,positive
Jesus villezcas is legit. We were from out of town and looking for somewhere to hang out.  The staff were very friendly and helpful and they have a great selection of Drafts. Fun atmosphere and tasty pizzas.  Can't go wrong with old Chicago.,1,positive
The cheese steak stromboli is absolutely amazing....the pizza....perfect....then there's the pancake fries (?) don't try them.....you will be hooked. This is a great local family owned fantastic pizza place!!,1,positive
Tried this place last night. SUPER TASTY PIZZA. We ordered the Supreme for 22.00 The slices are HUGE. The dough is a perfect mix of fluffy crust but dense at the same time and the toppings seem fresh. Also ordered Chicken Cesar salad that I was super unimpressed with. I didn't care for the dressing. Next time I'll do just pizza. They nailed it in that department.,1,positive
This is one of our favorite places for pizza & its so close to home!\nI love a deep dish pizza!! And Rosati's does it really well. Its not the cheapest pizza in town but 1 slice fills you up so you have plenty of leftovers..which reheat awesome!\nThey also have very good customer service..love that!,1,positive
"#1 Bros. is our local pizza joint and I'm an ex-NYer and we just love this place. The family is so nice, just like one of the last commenters...they guys will chat with us about sports or just whatever. They are so friendly and I love their food. They have great pizza, antipasto salad and I love their eggplant parmesan sub. \nIt's a great place for a quick slice or to take the family. I love that it is family owned and operated and it shows!",1,positive
"Finally, a pizza place that satisfies the individual pizza taste buds of my family! We ordered the Rocky's Philly Steak Pizza along with a cheese pizza and both were delicious! Everyone left happy.",1,positive
Love the great Rustica pizza and they also have a Gluten Free crust available that is also delicious! Great ambiance and excellent customer service top off a great dining experience!,1,positive
"I love,  love,  love the homemade pappardelle with tomato cream sauce.  They do their best to accommodate everyone and are always friendly.  My kids enjoy the kids' pizza and they have great cappuccino.   I highly recommend Cafepino.  It's s great little secret in North Scottsdale!",1,positive
Best pizza in town. That's a tough title to earn with Jimmy and Joes right down the street.,1,positive
"Went to Nick's tonight, this is our second or third time trying with this place. YUM! Very good pizza. \n\nAlso, on Mondays and Tuesdays they have a killer special, any size pizza, any number of toppings - half price. SO my large pepperoni pizza tonight was ~$6.50. Awesome.\n\nDecent pizza, great prices, especially with their Monday/Tuesday special!!",1,positive
"We frequent Antonio's on a regular basis, and they are hands down the best pizza-by-the-slice in town! \n\nThey make a variety of unique and creative pizzas- that are always served fresh. Spicy Beef Taco, Chicken Florentine, and Chicken, Bacon, Ranch- just to name a few. My go-to slice is the Chicken Quesadilla! Absolutely delish!",1,positive
"I love Mellow Mushroom.  I saw where another reviewer posted a statement comparing MM to Papa John's and I don't agree at all.  I like Papa John's for \""""big box store\"""" pizza, but they don't hold a candle to MM.  The pizza crust, fresh ingredients, and great craft brew beer selection make for a great eating experience.  I agree the stoner thing is inappropriate and the service at this location leaves a bit to be desired but, all in all, it's hard to beat the 'Shroom.",1,positive
"Love Oregano's :) \n\nThe 45 minute wait for deep dish pizza does not bother me much because I know I am going to get it just the way I like it. Lots of pepperoni and easy sauce. The BBQ wings are so good. They are crispy, hot, and bathed in sauce. Service at Oregano's has never failed me. In Tucson, AZ and in Phoenix, AZ service is great :)",1,positive
"Good Lord does Fatso's have the BEST pizza around. No seriously, it's the bees knees! I just moved back from California and you best believe this was my 1st pizza stop!!! YUM!",1,positive
I love Sbarro's I used to eat. This pizza as a kid at the local mall. Service was great and the pizza was as I remembered it. If you are here and want to grab something quick this is a good place to go too. When fling out of Philly I will be headed back here for my hunger needs.,1,positive
"While the place itself is relatively small and kind of a hike from Pitt's campus it is definitely the best pizza in Oakland. Reasonable priced, fast service, good food, what more could you ask for? Also no, don't bother asking for delivery.",1,positive
"was told Joeys had great pizza when I moved in to town,I have to say for a small place they do a great business and the pizza is always hot and delicious when it arrives at the door.",1,positive
"I first saw the concept for this type of pizza place in San Diego called project pie. Mod pizza is pretty close but if they really worked hard and used really high quality ingredients and better soda selection, they'd be 5 stars just like project pie (see my review from earlier this year). Still, mod pizza is pretty good, and I'll probably be a regular.",1,positive
"Chicago styled pizza - thin crust, \""""square cut\"""" is delicious. Have gotten a few wrong items in delivery, but they've been good about correcting  (the waiting time is tough). Double check your order before the driver leaves! Usually very friendly staff. Great pizza & Italian beef - Gardinera is great. Items on the higher end of pricing  for \""""pizza type food\"""" - but flavour is wonderful.",1,positive
"The good things about Z Pizza: It's open late, it's close to downtown, and they have vegan options.\n\nThe bad: It's a chain, they have like 6 parking spots, and the crust sticks to your teeth.  Seriously.  Also, I don't know if it's the type of vegan cheese or the way they prepare it, but it's just not that good.  It looks and tastes fake.  Pizza Heaven does it better.\n\nThis place gets the job done...but BARELY.",0,negative
"Best calzone I have eaten in the Charlotte area.  Lots of ricotta.  They are always pack full and they don't skimp on the meat (I like to get pepperoni and sausage).  \n\nPizza is real good.  I haven't been to NY, so can't compare.  They are huge.  The smallest pizza box won't even fit in my fridge.\n\nPhilly sub is awesome and of course, loaded up!\n\nOh yeah, garlic bread with cheese is a great...really cheesy with butter and garlic!  Mmm!",1,positive
"Metro Pizza has turned into one of my family's favorite places to eat. We're now regulars here, thanks to the food and great service",1,positive
"My family has been going to Nikki Lee's for years now and always enjoyed the PIzza and Wings special.  We are big fans of the fried eggplant pizza with the BBQ and teriyaki flavored wings.  The bar and restaurant are very basic but adequate enough to enjoy a cocktail and your favorite sport.  Overall, well priced and well run.",1,positive
"I've been going to Floridino's for a few years, but I wasn't a huge-huge fan until they started making buffalo chicken pizza muffins. They're wonderful. Now I understand why my family dragged me back so often. The pizza muffins are great. Floridino's has good salads and decent pastas, but the pizza muffins are to die for.",1,positive
"I've been spoiled with pizza on the east coast, and this is the only place I can go for my fix now. Joe's is that perfect slice no matter how early you stop in or how drunk you are at night. I always get my slices \""""well done\"""" to ensure crispness. Amazing pizza and everything else on the menu holds up.",1,positive
"Best place for pizza as a dairy free, gluten free person. The one time my mother and I had an issue with service - our waitress forgot to bring buffalo sauce until after we finished eating and we couldn't find her while we were eating - we received a free dessert without asking. They are very quick with take-out too. And their happy hour is amazing!",1,positive
Best Pizza in the city!,1,positive
Cant go wrong with the tostada pizza and all the other unique pizzas. I always enjoy trying something new here. The price/portion is just right for me. The salads are also very large portions and tasty.,1,positive
"We ordered from Angelo's after having a bad experience with another local italian delivery place (Grand Italia). Angelo's definitely helped to redeem our night. Their employees were polite. And service was decently quick for Delivery. We ordered the Chicken Tenders (Honey BBQ, and Garlic Parmesan), and Fries. The food was tasty.",1,positive
"Out of the big three pizza places, Domino's is always the last I would choose.\n\nI find thier based stodgy, the toppings greasy and also I think they are bloody expensive compared to Papa Johns or Pizza Hut. They take forever to make and deliver, and the staff never seem to be happy.\n\nIf you do find you have to go to Domino's, go on tuesdays when the deals may save you some money.",0,negative
"Casanova Brothers is the best! The owners are there everyday and make a point of introducing themselves and learning your name. Pretty cool when there is a family/friend owned business that works well and they want to make you a part of their family. The pizza is amazing of course, but they have really good sandwiches and salads as well.",1,positive
"I like Venezia's for lunch, the slices are huge the wings are some of the best, and you don't have to spend a lot!!   If you like NY style pizza your will enjoy Venezia's.",1,positive
"We visited the location on Alma School, pizza was OK, The Tempe location is definitely better in both food and service.",0,negative
"Every time I come in Donny and his sons are always so attentive.  Pizza by the slice, zucchini fries and spumoni.... yum!

"This local pizza joint gets an A+ from me and my boyfriend. We are lucky enough to be neighbors with this place, and are impressed with it over and over again!\nWe always order the Raffaele's special (which is a little steep at $20 for a large) but its always worth it. \nA down to earth local pizza joint that is consistent, friendly, and oh so yummy!",1,positive
"YUM! I was trying to think of something different for lunch. Sometimes, I get tired of the Estrella Parkway choices...Then, I remembered this little gem. The food is so yummy.

Barro's pizza is super good. I go to Barro's almost once everyday and get their Honey BBQ traditional wings. I would highly recommend it. The chicken that's used is really good the sauce is divine. I love Buffalo Wild Wings but for the price and the size of the wings I recommend Barro's. Plus the waiters and waitresses have been SUPER awesome! Great customer service there is a reason I keep coming back and giving them my business.,1,positive
"Right down the street from my house so I always go and pick up my pizza. Pizza is always ready when they say it will be,  piping hot. Cashiers are always upbeat and friendly.  Right now Mon-Thursday you can get a large 3 topping for $7.99. I used to hate Domino's but since they have changed their recipes I have become a fan. Their pan pizza is my go to for pizza style. They also do a decent Brooklyn style pizza, but being from NY/NJ there's no comparison to the real thing!",1,positive
"The pizza here is definitely good. It's a little pricey but worth a try. I do enjoy brick oven pizza and the atnosphere is pretty neat (dare I say \""""romantic\""""?) I may return sometime with the wife.",1,positive
"We love Pizza Pizza. Good pizza and wings. The 20.99 deal with XL 1 topping pizza and 24 wings is great. Being from ny I'm pretty picky, so its nice to have this place nearby.",1,positive
"Ahh yes, Sardella's and their $5 medium pizza special. The location near 19th Ave and Union is my Sardella's home base. We grab a cheapie medium cheese to go quite often (the price is not good for delivery).\n\nThe toppings, ingredients & cheese is much better than what you would find at those national chains.\n\nFor a small shop cooked, good medium pizza, you can't beat 5 bucks. Try their ranch dressing as well. It's made in house and is delish.",1,positive
"Jamie's is fantastic! Pretty fast, locally owned, and really cheap. Their calzones are huge and delicious, and the same goes for their pizzas! They've messed up my order once or twice, but they're really nice about fixing it and giving me the messed-up order for free. Highly recommend it!",1,positive
"Red Rick pizza has a many especially pizzas available! If you feel like trying something new, this will be a good place. Ei. Nacho pizza!",1,positive
"I wasn't a fan of Al's at all...\n\nI ordered a deluxe pizza for pick up. The crust had no flavor, and the toppings didn't have any great qualities either. Did I mention that the pizza was $20??? I've had delivery pizza that was more flavorful at half the price!\n\nThe toasted ravioli was OK, but it wasn't as good as it would have been from a true Italian restaurant because the marinara wasn't very flavorful either.\n\nJust go to the real pizza place down the street.",0,negative
"I enjoyed Ray's Pizza. The sauce and toppings were flavorful and it was not too greasy. I did not experience \""""Ray's Revenge\"""" as my in-laws said I might so Ray's is a win in my book.",1,positive

"I am a huge fan of Tony's.   The pizza is always fresh, the ingredients are large, and the pie is hot.   Out of 30 or so times of ordering pizza at this specific location, I have never been disappointed.  When my folks come down from VA they demand to go eat here for lunch, with or without me.\n\nThe service is not exceptionally good but I an overlook that for a few moments of folded pizza, greasy fingered goodness.  I highly recommend this spot for those that enjoy pizza.",1,positive

"I find myself gravitating towards the pork reigns specialty pizza.  Sometimes dough can be undone but nothing a little oven time can't fix at home.  The owner/manager is awesome, he REALLY cares about his customers and product he's putting out. The garlic knots I do find myself unable to share with anyone else but myself.  Plan on going back as long as I live in the area.",1,positive
"I always have a positive experience at Federal Pizza! They have a great lunch special that comes with a personal sized pizza and side salad for about $8.

Local favorite here on Nuns Island for Lunch and Dinner or just a drink after work.\nGreat selection of pizzas (their specialty) but also many other things.\nReally great outdoor terrace for summer times :) \n\nFavorite Pizza: The Chez Carl,1,positive
"We came in with a large group, late on a Saturday night with some tired kids from a swim meet.  Oregano's was impossible to get into, so we tried Frankie's...we were not disappointed!

A friend had a salad and she said it was fresh and satisfying, another friend was pleased with an entree.  Quick and good for the amount paid.",1,positive
"I prefer Pizza Hut to other brands . Here in Tempe [where I moved to from Denver, Colo] there are MANY competing Pizza places in this ASU college city. \nI have tried them all, and most are quite tasty and affordable. However-this Pizza Hut offers the BEST deals and Best service on what I consider the BEST tasting Pizza in town!\n If you want to save some money and be totally satisfied, then ENJOY this Pizza Hut pizza! [PS.-I only review/post very exceptional or very poor]",1,positive
Excellent pizza! \n\nI was in there two weeks ago and the owner recommended the Philly in a wrap version. I have never heard of it in a wrap version so I ordered it and I now know what I'll order every time I go it there.,1,positive
"I've always loved wolfman pizza since Barry brought California style pizza to Charlotte, NC in 1991.  Great food and great management make eating here a no brainer.  I've found the Providence Commons location to be very consistent even during busy times.  Their wolf bites with their home made bleu cheese are a great starter and their buffalo chicken pizza is off the hook.  YUM!!",1,positive
"I love Rigitony's. They have good, homemade pastas. They have great lunch specials. Its affordable and fresh. I have not had the pizza. My favorite is the baked spaghetti and meatballs. Fresh and chunky marinara is amazing. I would take this place over most major italian places.",1,positive
At AJ's you can buy fresh baked pizza. Try it. It's honestly one of best pizza's you will ever have. \nStaff is very nice. Overall great experience.,1,positive
"The best pizza in Avondale/Goodyear, bar none. They occasionally go overboard on toppings, but who is complaining?  The Greek and Fat Hawaiian specialty pizzas are great. The wings are good, too. Try the 9-1-1 wings if you like heat. The service is generally attentive. Rob is the best wait person.  PBR bottle specials are a plus.",1,positive
Great pizza.. I would prefer some other places over this one if were talking favorites but I do hit this place up at least twice a month.. Good stuff,1,positive
"Groupon find. Had their specialty pizza - fig and jalapeno, add chicken.  Delicious pizza, got the large, and it lasted 2 people for 3 meals.  Friendly staff and fresh ingredients!",1,positive
Eggplant pizza is the best. the pasta is just ok. they are nice on phone and average on wait time. The short delivery girl  is very sweet an nice.,1,positive
"To be fair, I do know the folks that run this place.  BUT -- I would love Manolo's anyway.  I think they have a creative menu -- not standard ingredients in their empanadas and pizza.  Very large pizza slices, and they always make it fresh.  You can buy their stuff when you are in the Canopy Club, too.  I've turned several people on to this place and I truly miss it now that I'm gone.  I think it is really affordable and a nice change to the usual pizza and campus food scene.",1,positive
You can never go wrong with Barro's. Their pizza is ALWAYS delicious and their wings are to die for!,1,positive
"I love the selection of pizza here, 2 of my favorites are the buffalo chicken and the macaroni & cheese.",1,positive
Hole in the wall pizza places are the best. No where to sit but it was nice outside. \nMushroom and sausage pizza was awesome. Fresh ingredients. Thin sliced. Wonderful pizza. Crust was good but I've had better so 4 stars.,1,positive
"best place for delivery in the south west area. Great pizza, submarines, and chicken souvlaki, not the cheapest place but best for price vs quality. if youre in verdun i dont recommend ordering during the rush hour, 12-2 or 5-7, theyre too busy and will take along time to arrive",1,positive
"Ahh! A taste of Chicago right here at home. I've tried all the places that claim to be Chicago style, and before, only Amore Pizza was a true fit. Windy City is also the real deal. They do combos and dogs just like back home on the south side. They even have pizza puffs and tom tom tamales. Only their fries are better than any I had in Chicago, crispy and fluffy on the inside, slighty salty, just perfect with ketchup. Looks like we'll be regulars.",1,positive
"Chizona's is awesome. The atmosphere is great, the staff was really friendly and helpful the first time we went in, not to mention the pizza is a delicious traditional Chicago style, which is hard to find around here. I have yet to try the chicago beef, but it's next on the list. Fantastic spot.",1,positive
"Having been to the original in Berwyn and also to the Villa Park location way back when I was excited to see that they were going in by my house in AZ.  This place brings back memories of \""""Back home\""""....the pizza is still the best.

"I LOVE NYP&P, thay make one of the best pies in Las Vegas ( and i base this on a lot of places i've eaten) Their house salad reminds me of eating at my Nonna's hose when i was little, and their Sicilian pizza is by far the best i've ever had in Vegas.\nAll their ingredients are fresh and tasty, and i just found out that on Sundays during football season they do a deal with a bucket of bear (get the Costello it's great) and a large 1 topping pizza for $25! i know where i'm taking all my buddies on Sundays from now on!",1,positive

"Here is the deal with Falbo's\n\nDon''t expect any, and I mean any, customer service. Expect to call and have the person on the other end of the phone be rude and inattentive. Also, always have exact change if you get it delivered, Falbo's drivers are known to not carry change. \n\nThat being said, their pizza and salads are boss. This is a working mans pizza (food not price) and damn it is good. The salads are also amazing and generously portioned. \n\nIf you can put up with the attitude, falbo's is worth every penny.",1,positive
"I have enjoyed Rosati's since they opened. Very good consistent pizza. Love their Chicago style deep dish or even Rosati's style if I wanna go light on tomato. \n\nI knocked off one star due to their pricing as the pizza can get very expensive and they rarely have coupons and they do not accept other Rosati's coupons. \n\nAlso, their lunch buffet could have more variety for the pizza choices but its a good price!",1,positive
xl pick up pizza good deal. ghetto area\n wouldn't walk there at nite. Chick taking orders kinda rude. Expensive for delivery but pick up u get what u pay for.,1,positive
"I'm obsessed with Oregano's. I've had their pizza a bunch of times but on my recent visit I had the Oregano's Favorite Salad which has sundried tomatoes, feta, roasted red peppers, pine nuts and red onions in it. LOVE it.  The Bistro Classic pizza is my favorite -- it's a white pizza with tomatoes, basil, and four cheeses on a super thin crust. YUM. I had to finish my meal off with the much talked about pizza cookie. It was RIDICULOUS. Don't leave without trying it. Trust me.",1,positive

I grew up eating Ray's Pizza at 59th/Greenway.  I find the pizza at Napoli to be quite similar if not exactly the same.  I think Napoli does the crust better.  Wings are good too.,1,positive
"Huge fan of mellow mushroom in the north valley! They always have a great beer selection of local and out of state craft brews. Their menu is a great mix of classic pizza recipes and really unique ones from the restaurant itself. \n\nI have been to two different mellow locations, one here in Arizona and another in north Carolina, Arizona hands down is way better! Not sure if the other was a franchise or not, but believe me the Arizona location is by far way better!",1,positive
Jesus villezcas is legit. We were from out of town and looking for somewhere to hang out.  The staff were very friendly and helpful and they have a great selection of Drafts. Fun atmosphere and tasty pizzas.  Can't go wrong with old Chicago.,1,positive
"Favorite casual pizza place! I always get the pesto chicken slice and a Greek salad. The pizza is great if you like the New York style where it's thin but not so crispy that it doesn't flop down. Salads are fresh, I've had the wings as well and they're okay but you definitely come here for the pizza. Never had a bad experience at Venezia's and I've been to the Chandler and Tempe locations as well.",1,positive
"Divine thin crust pizza, great salads, appetizers, wings, and pizza cookies (left a little doughy with ice cream on top). The service is always great as is the atmosphere. The wait can be a long on weekend nights but the food is worth it. Lunch specials are also good and it's a great place for a work lunch. Large patio area is a perfect place to eat most of the year. \n\nMy go-to menu items are the Pablo Picasso salad, the N\u00famero One-O on thin crust, and a peanut butter pizza cookie.",1,positive
I grew up outside of Chicago and Gino's East was always my favorite deep dish. Amore is the closest thing you can get to authentic Chicago deep dish here in Vegas. Their thin crust and other dishes are pretty good too.,1,positive

"Stopped here on a Sunday evening for a quick bite to go.  This place is a little divey, but Sal makes it worth the trip.  I am giving 5 stars because the pizza was damn good and Sal.  He was friendly and comical and he puts out a great product.  We had the pepperoni and sausage pizza and the lasagna pizza.  Both were extremely satisfying.  So if you are in the South Side and looking for a late bite of pizza, hit up Sal's.  He's open and you won't be disappointed.",1,positive
"Good local pizza place in Cave Creek. We took out, but they had a nice eat-in area. Pizzas are delish. Crust excellent. No skimping on the sauce and cheese. We had a meat lovers (an artery clogging delight), Haiwian (yummy), and a thin crust BBQ chicken (tangy). Can't go wrong at this place.",1,positive
I love Sbarro's I used to eat. This pizza as a kid at the local mall. Service was great and the pizza was as I remembered it. If you are here and want to grab something quick this is a good place to go too. When fling out of Philly I will be headed back here for my hunger needs.,1,positive

"Best calzone I have eaten in the Charlotte area.  Lots of ricotta.  They are always pack full and they don't skimp on the meat (I like to get pepperoni and sausage).  \n\nPizza is real good.  I haven't been to NY, so can't compare.  They are huge.  The smallest pizza box won't even fit in my fridge.\n\nPhilly sub is awesome and of course, loaded up!\n\nOh yeah, garlic bread with cheese is a great...really cheesy with butter and garlic!  Mmm!",1,positive
"Coming from Chicago, I'm a pretty big pizza snob. I just haven't found much good pizza in Charlotte. I'd say Wolfman's is the best, and Fuel is among the worst. It's just not very good. I think I'd enjoy a frozen Digorno pizza much better. I really wanted to like Fuel. Their locations in old rehabbed gas stations are really cute, and there are locations all over, including one that is about a block from my house. But I've just been disappointed whenever I tried it.",0,negative

This is one of our favorite places for pizza & its so close to home!\nI love a deep dish pizza!! And Rosati's does it really well. Its not the cheapest pizza in town but 1 slice fills you up so you have plenty of leftovers..which reheat awesome!\nThey also have very good customer service..love that!,1,positive
"Hands down the best pizza in North Shore. I choose Georgios every time when I get a pizza craving. No delivery and cash only doesn't bother me, and if you want a good pizza it shouldn't bother you either. My favorite is good old pepperoni. They use the little pepperoni slices so they curl up and the grease pools in the middle mmm mmm! This is the way pizza should taste!

"My friend's and I have been going to Enzo's since we were in highschool.  Now, 15 years later, it is still my go to pizza joint.

"My favorite is the Thai pizza sans chicken.  Wow.  Yum!  Anyone that puts bean sprouts on their pizza and can pull it off with flair and taste has to be given kudos!  Great veggie pizza by the slice...there's always one meat, one veg, and cheese...perfect!  Cozy spot to have a beer and grab a slice.  Plus, they usually have a special for two slices and a beer...so even better!",1,positive

"I recently did a pizza crawl through squirrel hill with a friend, where we hit every single one of squirrel hill's 7 pizzerias, and got a slice of pepperoni pizza at each one in a row!  Napoli's had the best pepporoni hands down, and in our opinion the 2nd best pizza over all next to mineos.  Napoli's pizza's a bit greasy, but very good over all, fast, cheap, and has the most crispy and flavorful pepperoni of any pizzeria in squirrel hill.  A must for any pepperoni lovers!",1,positive
Best pizza in the city. Period.,1,positive
"I am a huge fan of Tony's.   The pizza is always fresh, the ingredients are large, and the pie is hot.   Out of 30 or so times of ordering pizza at this specific location, I have never been disappointed.  When my folks come down from VA they demand to go eat here for lunch, with or without me.\n\nThe service is not exceptionally good but I an overlook that for a few moments of folded pizza, greasy fingered goodness.  I highly recommend this spot for those that enjoy pizza.",1,positive

"#1 Bros. is our local pizza joint and I'm an ex-NYer and we just love this place. The family is so nice, just like one of the last commenters...they guys will chat with us about sports or just whatever. They are so friendly and I love their food. They have great pizza, antipasto salad and I love their eggplant parmesan sub. \nIt's a great place for a quick slice or to take the family. I love that it is family owned and operated and it shows!",1,positive
"The pizza by the slice is bad if you ask me, very thick, and consisting mostly of blandish sourdough -like crust. Like a flat loaf of white bread with prego and some melted string cheese. \n\nThe italian beef ain't bad but it's not exactly spicy either - Dom's is currently my pick to click considering the sad state of italian beef in champaign.",0,negative

We've been back several times over the last two months and haven't had a bad meal yet.",1,positive

Not THE best pizza I've ever had but the best pizza in the area :) Try the pesto pizza! For about $7 you can get 2 slices and a drink.  Not that bad.  Whole pies are a bit pricier than the corporate go to's but this place is way better and the pizzas are HUGE (as well as the slices)! They're deserts are really good too and they have a really large selection of drinks.  Yummmmmyyyy!!!!!!!,1,positive
"Oh Ian's Pizza how I wish you lived near me... oh who am I kidding... how I wish I lived near YOU.  I can only speak for the kalamata mozzarella slice and it was mother frickin' frackin' delicious.  That is a damn 5 star slice o' pizza.  So good.  So amazingly good.  I could eat a slice every day good.  Oh right, I had a bite of a mushroom something or other pizza - deeeeelicious as well.  Health-wise, It's probably best we aren't neighbors.",1,positive
I always get the chicken Marsala her so good! Other favorites are spaghetti and meatball and chicken alfredo.

The room stank of smoke, was filfthy dirty with cigarette burns on the furniture, drapes and bedspread.  There were no toiletries. Asked front desk for housekeeping and they never came even after two requests.\nStay away!",0,negative
"I love Caesar's Palace and the Forum Shops. I always stay here when i'm in Vegas, but I am still waiting for them to ban smoking indoors. It's ridiculous that in 2014 you can still smoke indoors. I hate that when I come to EVERY casino I smell like a dirty ashtray and my sinuses swell and I feel like shit. Seriously, why people???? Ban smoking and you get 5*!",0,negative
hookah was always harsh the moment it was brought to our table. didn't have a good time here. the place seems to advertise that they specialize in hookah but it only looks like a side feature.,0,negative
If you hate the smell of cigarette and incense don't stay here. WiFi is not free ($11.99) at all as advertised.  The room keys does'n't work most of the time and I had mine replaced twice today. It is really  frustrating and I will never stay here again.\nOnly nice thing to say about this place is the workers are nice and helpful but otherwise go somewhere else if you are concern about your health.,0,negative

"Reserved a non smoking room, was given a \""""smoking optional\"""" room.  The smell is horrible.

Attempted yesterday evening. . This is a smokers paradise.  There is no way for a non smoker to escape. . This appeared to be an all outdoor patio experience.  The bar is the centerpiece with tables in the surrounding perimeter.  Most people at the bar were smoking and one table. Called my friends that were on the way and changed plans. .,0,negative

"I have read many, many reviews about SMOKE and finally had the chance to go.  Simply amazing.  Flavors of nearly all tacos (a group of us shared six) were extraordinary.  Mac & cheese as a side for tacos?  Hell yeah - creamy and delicious with a nice sharp bite at the end.  Waitress was excellent as well.\n\nAs you already know from other reviews:  cash only and BYOB.\n\nWith so many good things to say, we were astounded to be the only patrons much of the visit.

I was at the joker last night with a good friend of mine.  \nWhen we came in no body said hello so we took a sit.  \nWe waited for 10-15 min for attention. \nThe hookah didn't last long and didn't have a lot of flavor or smoke.  \nWe usually go to a deferent hookah lounge but we were around there so we wanted to try this place.

"This was my third time staying at TI. The first two times were great, this last time not so much. Other casinos do a better job managing the smell of cigarettes. What really bothered me was the lack of AC in my room the first two nights. I was finally moved to a room with functional AC on the third night after repeated complaining. Too many hotels in Vegas to have to put up with this again.",0,negative

Went to Macayo's order the Baja pizza. Worst ever no longer a fan of there food. All it had on it was some spicy cheesy sauce and I ordered it with pork instead of chicken.  To my dismay the amount of pork could fit on a teaspoon. They used to have a happy hour that was not present @ happy hour. Also found out there well tequila was piss poor. So order a premium Margarita. Good luck on quality of food!,0,negative
"Sopes Pastor, yum.\n\nTotally delicious marinated pork with Mexican cheese, lettuce, tomato and avocado. Very filling for $3.50. Mango Jarritos soda, a real treat. Next time I will eat a burrito. Looked large and the one sopes was plenty.\n\nRustic but comfortable. Mexican TV in the background. Restaurant portion of store hidden in the back.  Tricky strip mall to find. Worth the effort.\n5 star food, 4 star ambiance and service.",1,positive

"If you need some delicious authentic Mexican food Pepe's is the place for you.\n\nThe Carnitas de Puerco, slow roasted pork in their delicious green sauce is out of this world.

Must try the guacamole...and their pulled pork dishes are phenomenal!! I have yet to eat anything bad from here. Very authentic and very good. They make the guacamole fresh right in front of you.,1,positive

"Love that they are open 24/7 and that they will give me a burrito without the tortilla.  Their Carne Asada burrito sans the tortilla is a plate of meat, guacamole, and pico...so good. \n\nIf you can eat carbs, which I don't, go for the cheese enchiladas. I miss those.  They are quite tasty!",1,positive
Tuna tostada is the s*#t! A must every time we go! \n\n on the appetizer menu there's little tacos dorados with guajillo sauce and queso fresco- sooooo good! \n\nTortilla soup is nice \n\nMy husband is Mexican and a chef and he is always satisfied when he comes here...,1,positive
Amazing chile rellanos!  This is the place to get authentic New Mexico style green chile dishes.  \n\nTheir fry bread is delicious as either a taco or dessert.  I haven't had a bad meal here.  They offer chips and great salsa if you eat in.  My family loves this place and it is our go to mexican place.  \n\nIt is tucked away in a corner of a strip mall that you can't see from the street.  It is a great find and once you know where it is you will keep coming back.,1,positive
"We had our local \""""Lunch Club here on Wednesday and everyone had the Taco Buffet. I was surprized when I saw all the other items in the buffet. I tried a little of everything and loved it all. They have a nice side room if you want to hold a meeting or event like we did. The service was prompt and they handled our group of 35+ without a hitch. Thanks, We'll be back often!!",1,positive
"Carne Asada Burrito is top-notch!! Their tacos are awesome too. It's basically a food truck with tables under an awning in the parking lot of Charlies Bar. Nice employees, good food, can get extremely busy so be prepared to wait at peak times. Highly recommend.",1,positive
Tried this place based on a friends recommendation and yelp reviews. This is a place that holds true to its reviews. It is located inside a gas station. The portions are huge and the food is delicious. We ordered carne asada nachos and chicken tortas. Both were amazing! I would definitely come here again! Move over Robertos. My new favorite mexican joint. Oh and the tortilla chips are the freshest I've ever had! They are cooked to order!! I don't know how many restaurants can say that.,1,positive
"Not a bad spot for some quick southwestern food!  I got the carnitas burrito with lime-Cilantro rice, pinto beans and the rest of the fixings and it was very good!  The chips and salsa are good and everything is fresh! I really like that their meats don't have any antibiotics or hormones! You get a lot for your money.",1,positive

Slightly pricey but worth the occasional visit. :)",1,positive
"My Husband and I had lunch today at Federicos, he loves their Fish burritos, they are huge  !  we live in scottsdale, but visit this mexican restaurant often, so worth the drive!   they also have good green chile !  they make their beans with soy, so they do  taste a little different !! this place is very clean also !!   good food ! good prices !",1,positive
"Hidden in an old Chinese restaraunt, this spot has GREAT Peruvian style roasted chicken. The plantains are also spot on. Cheap and quick, it's not much for atmosphere but a great place to stop on the way home and grab some chicken and a salad (try adding avocado to your salads). At least a handful of my friends love going here whenever their in town. Definitely worth it.",1,positive
"my go to mexican restaurant now!  inexpensive and delicious!  everything is very fresh and well prepared.  I typically get the chicken taco with their homemade tortilla, the bean tostada, and the ceviche tostada.  their ceviche is the best I have had in the city.  not to mention their salsa is always fresh, a little hot, and very good with the free chips.  ummmmm!!!",1,positive
"I found this place through Yelp and I'm glad I did. It's on the small side and it's super busy but service is quick and the food is good. They really have a variety of things to order from breakfast stuff to quesadillas, to burgers and pitas. For me I gotta have the jalapeno burger which is always cooked perfect. It's hard to find a place that doesn't over cook their burger meat.",1,positive

My favorite by far!  I travel once a week thru airport and always make sure to stop by. I get either the chicken enchiladas or the carne asada burrito with green chili sauce.  Always fresh and tasty. Highly recommend!!,1,positive

"I've been going to Macayo's for probably 30 years. I love it. The TCT is extra yummy. I usually get either the shredded beef burrito enchilada style or chicken fingers, both delicious. I also used to get the gringo cheeseburger which was always good as well. My husband loves the Sonoran Wings spicy.",1,positive
We enjoy eating at this Mexican Restaurant a couple of times a month.  You are served Hot Giant Tortilla Chips with Fresh Tasty Salsa before every meal.  I've tried several dishes but one of my favorites is the Chile Verde.  My husband usually gets whatever the special is for that day and it's always delicious.  The Restaurant is open to the Bakery so it's hard to pass up on a dessert.  The service is always personal and friendly.  This Restaurant is located on 6055 E Lake Mead Blvd and I would say give it a try.,1,positive
Love their breakfast burritos!! Haven't tried anything else there but very happy with the breakfast!!,1,positive
"Eh asada burrito was unimpressive and bordering on bad but I also adjusted since it's airport food...  Also, it was closing very soon, so maybe it was just a bad batch.\n\nUnfortunately won't recommend =P",0,negative
"This place is awesome!  I walked by it during the Tempe Arts Festival.  A paleteria on Mill Ave?!  I just had to walk in.\nI chose a Nuez paleta because that has always been my favorite flavor.  My dad hails from Michoacan, MX where these paletas originated, so I've had quite a few in my life.  It was a little different than what I'm used to, mainly because the nuts used were much bigger than usual.  This wasn't a bad thing at all though.  In fact, the paleta was delicious and I would definitely recommend this place.",1,positive
"Taco Bell... I favor the #7 and #8. Sometimes with nachos, sometimes with a burrito. However, a #8 with a burrito is like 1375 calories if you choose soda with your included drink. I think it's worth it sometimes... Other times I shudder the thought.",1,positive
"I love Mexican food. Especially when it's Real Mexican food and this place is great. Been to a place similar so we tried the al pastor tacos and burrito. So good! All the salsas were great and spicy, also got the Mexican style corn and my boyfriend inhaled it! Can't wait to try the quesadilla, bowl and vampiro, it's far but worth it !",1,positive
"I've been going to Pedro's for over 20 years. This place is outstanding. From the chips and salsa to the sopapillas you can't go wrong. I typically get the stuffed quesadilla, the best in the biz. However, everything is good. \n\nAlso, ask for the pico de gallo to spice things up a little. They don't bring it to the table unless you ask for it but it is awesome. Great with chips or on your meal!! Enjoy!!",1,positive
I lucked out finding Tortas El Rey. The food is always fresh and delicious and the staff is friendly.  I suggest the chicken quesadilla. It is served with beans and guacamole inside the quesadilla and is awesome.,1,positive
"Originally being from Ft. Worth, I completely appreciate the food at Casa Rita's - authentic TexMex in the tradition of the Mexican Inn. It has been open a little less than a year but it good. I love and miss brisket and I can get my fix here with their enchiladas and tacos.\n\nIf you get a chance to try it, get a side of the spicy slaw. It is a good bit spicy but it's great on the soft tacos or just as a side. House made salsa also makes this place an up and coming gem in town.",1,positive
"Best bean and cheese burrito. Ever. And it's vegetarian friendly. Please go try the burrito, I'm on the other side of the country and can't -- you can. Go right now. \n\nI literally drive straight to America's when I fly into Phoenix for business.\n\nThe newer site on 7th ave is less busy. If you're in a hurry, call ahead - they do carry-out fast!",1,positive
"Sneaked into Las Vegas last month (Lol! Many of you know why!) and indulged Roberto's! It's fresh and fast. I saw the three orders before, the Carne Asada fries, I had to try them. Delicious. So delicious that I had to take one of my chicken tacos back to my hotel. I had those carrots and peppers before and packed up almost a 1/2 pint! My only wish Roberto's was north of the boarder in San Francisco!",1,positive
"I love Baja Miguel's for lunch.  They have a lunch special for $8.95, which consists of two items, beans and rice, fideo soup, and a margarita (or substitute drink).  Since I am usually here during my work lunch break, I get a virgin margarita, which is still delicious.  They also bring out chips and dip pretty much as soon as you sit down.",1,positive
"I had the Pollo Torta...and for $7, it is an insanely large sandwich with mounds of fresh chicken and delicious condiments (like the black bean spread or the fresh cabbage).  You've gotta ask for the \""""avocado crema\"""" to be added to whatever you order!  I was thoroughly satisfied, and am excited about its great location downtown!",1,positive
"The customer service here almost tops the food, frank is just a cool dude all around and will lay the details out for you if your a first timer. I say go for the chicken torta with side beans and rice. You can't go wrong with anything here though honestly.",1,positive
I love Macayos.  Traditional authentic Mexican food yet still very unique.  Love all the bright colors and atmosphere.  THE BAJA CHIMI!  For that matter anything on their menu with the Baja sauce is to die for.  Really like the salsa.  Good margaritas too.,1,positive
"I ate at the original barrio cafe on 16th which was very good and interesting (maybe a little overpriced) but definetly recommended.  The airport barrio cafe was like the owner lost control of the car and drove off the road that has taken them to success.  I ordered a burrito (don't remember which) but it was soggy, with what tasted like canned chicken and a ton of sour cream.  Nasty!!",0,negative
Tried this place the other day and had the green Chili and pork burrito combo (Uno on the lunch specials).  The portion was a good size and it is served with rice and beans.  They also serve chips with bean dip and salsa while you wait for your order.  This is going to be my go to Mexican restaurant in town.,1,positive
"I live in NYC, and was visiting family in Phoenix. They suggested this place, and it was delicious. Get their short rib tacos.  They are insane. And they come with freshly made corn tortillas that are incredible.  Top it with some guacamole, salsa, and kale cabbage...and it was one of the best tacos I have had.  They also cater towards those who are gluten free, which also makes it easier for me.  I only wish they had gluten free versions of the salted chocolate chip cookies they give out when you leave!",1,positive
"One of the best filibertos that I have been to, hands down. Carne Asada fries are actually made with the chunky crinkle cuts, unlike the wimpy tiny side fries like the ones found on apache and Dorsey's filibertos. Love the service, love the chip bar and the sauce bar, the girl who took my order at like 3am was nice, and every time I go there I have a good time, unlike the one at Apache and Dorsey! The place is clean and well maintained too.",1,positive
"When I need my Carne Asada taco fix, this is my go to place! \n\nAlways friendly, quick, reasonably priced & the quality of their carne asada tacos is right on :) Plus, I like that they don't charge me for extra lime to squeeze onto my tacos, lol",1,positive
I ALWAYS got to come here whenever in town. Love their freindly service and the loco moco. I've tried their other dishes but can't seem to get away from deciding on loco moco :P Fair price for the serving you get of food you don't find everywhere. Highly reccomend!,1,positive
Yuro Supreme with no sauce. Great everytime.\n\nI have been eating here for yrs never ever a complaint.,1,positive
"When my family was too short on time for a trip to Barrio Cafe, we slipped into Los Favoritos for some quick tacos, enchiladas and burritos. Nothing on the menu disappointed, and we visited again a few nights later during a late study session.",1,positive
I LOVE ROBERTO'S!!! If you want some quick Mexican food this is the place to go. They serve delicious food 24/7. Chicken-Taco-Wednesdays are the best; you can buy as many tacos as you want for $1. I also love their breakfast burritos and enchiladas.,1,positive
"One evening I had hungry, loud, complaining kids in my car and, out of sheer desperation, I turned into the drive through of this completely \nnon-descript \""""berto's\"""" looking kind of restaurant.\n\nWHAT a find!  Outstanding food, fast, cheap.  Happy day, happy kids.  We've been back a few times for pick-up.  No ambience, but that's not what they are about. Expect really good really reliable old school Mexican food.",1,positive
"It's Filiberto's. They are all similar, yet there is a considerable difference between shops when it comes to food quality and service.\n\nLike any Filiberto's, the burritos come with pure meat. Wanna add rice or beans? It'll cost ya! Wait... they have to remove meat to fit the rice/beans. Rice and beans are cheaper than meat! Why on earth would anyone charge more money when they are saving money??!?  Senseless.",0,negative
"Like this location, but they do have a tendency to mess up my order (-1 star)... but they kind of sort of - not really- make up for it with free extra corn tortillas! In love with their flame broiled chicken and cheap tacos al carbon!",1,positive
Mexican food is one of my favorites so every time I get a chance to eat at a Mexican restaurant I have to try the chimichanga.  This is by far is the best one I have found and I've tried a lot of places!  They also have wonderful tasting enchiladas and tacos.  The food tastes super fresh and you can tell they take the time to prepare their food the right way!,1,positive
"I've liked burrito express because they've always had cheap food and delivered. They increased the min delivery from $10 to $15 and also recently increased the prices on their menu. They have also removed many items from the menu and they will still make them for you at a more expensive price. Burrito express was my hangover spot for breakfast, but I probably won't be coming here anymore.",0,negative
"\""""How have I lived without their green sauce all my life?\""""\n\nThis place is just around the corner so we stop in every now and again. Rudy - the owner is super friendly as are the rest of his staff, his family. \n\nMy favorite is a bean and cheese burrito that I dump their green sauce into. BUT their tacos and tamales are delicious too. I haven't really had anything I didn't like. \n\nIf you're in the area stop in and try it!",1,positive
I lucked out finding Tortas El Rey. The food is always fresh and delicious and the staff is friendly.  I suggest the chicken quesadilla. It is served with beans and guacamole inside the quesadilla and is awesome.,1,positive

"I've been going to Julio's in Scottsdale for many years.  I love their Pollo Magnifico and their albondigas (Mexican meatball soup) is the best.  If you don't like beans and rice, they will sub salad or sauteed veggies.  It's been my experience that the servers are attentive and efficient - for a smile they will often bring free dessert!",1,positive

I typically get the chicken taco with their homemade tortilla, the bean tostada, and the ceviche tostada.  their ceviche is the best I have had in the city.  not to mention their salsa is always fresh, a little hot, and very good with the free chips.  ummmmm!!!",1,positive
This place has bomb carne asada tacos. How the heck do they get so much flava in that tiny taco? And the Tortas are delicious too. We usually go in the evening but I've heard there are lines out the door for lunch. Highly recommended. Oh and if you want a flan be sure to ask for it when you order or else it just might be gone :),1,positive
"I ordered a shrimp burro - they grilled the shrimp, filled it with lots of stuff, and smothered it with a delicious sour-cream type of sauce.\nThe all-you-can-eat chips and salsa are good.  No problem with doing your own refilling, that way you don't waste.  We loved mixing their hot and mild salsa together, and just having a container of each.\n(we ate in, but I see that they do a pretty good \""""take-out\"""" business as well)  They're close to a water store, so if you need to refill your 5-gallon bottles...",1,positive
"I love burrito drive! First, they are the only delivery place to brings piping hot burritos to your door...until 3am. Talk about service! :-) Second, I am a super picky eater so I always get the build your own, which is more than I can eat in one sitting and at a reasonable price! :-)",1,positive
This place has bomb carne asada tacos. How the heck do they get so much flava in that tiny taco? And the Tortas are delicious too. We usually go in the evening but I've heard there are lines out the door for lunch. Highly recommended. Oh and if you want a flan be sure to ask for it when you order or else it just might be gone :),1,positive
You can never go wrong here with anything that you order. The staff is always friendly and willing to help you navigate thought the menu. They even recommend something that wasn't on the menu. The chipotle sandwich would have to be my favorite.,1,positive
"I really like this place!  The food is so good and fast.  I think the longest we've waited is about 10 minutes to get our food...I would strongly suggest the carne asada plate.  Awesome meat!  There is guacamole on the side, along with rice, beans, and tortillas.  Can't go wrong!  \n\nIt's kind of a random location off of Maryland and Pebble...just look right behind/next to the Shell Station and you'll see it.",1,positive
I like Serranos but sometimes their food seems a little too pre-made for my tastes. They have good salsa and bean dip and a good selection on the menu. Their veggie enchiladas are good as well as the spinach enchiladas. I like that they have fresh homemade tortillas. They aren't the best tortillas I've had but kudos that they don't use the waxy pre-packaged junk that a lot of places use.,1,positive
Great fresh mex! Love the salmon tacos with a mango salsa. I don't think you can go wrong with anything from Tia Rosas!\n\nThis is a well established restaurant in the valley and has been loved by the locals for years. Always fresh and good.,1,positive
We enjoy eating at this Mexican Restaurant a couple of times a month.  You are served Hot Giant Tortilla Chips with Fresh Tasty Salsa before every meal.  I've tried several dishes but one of my favorites is the Chile Verde.  My husband usually gets whatever the special is for that day and it's always delicious.  The Restaurant is open to the Bakery so it's hard to pass up on a dessert.  The service is always personal and friendly.  This Restaurant is located on 6055 E Lake Mead Blvd and I would say give it a try.,1,positive
What can I say about Filibertos. It's one of my go to's for lunch. Never been disappointed in their food. Always good and always hot. And plus if you go inside you can get there are avocado salsa. One of my favorites!,1,positive
I know I gave Roberto's 5 stars but Fausto's is way better. They are just a lot farther away from my house. I love their carne asada and chips and cheese. Great place for a quick bite of tasty and blessedly unhealthy Mexican food.,1,positive
I really like Zaba's - I had the buritto bowl last night.  The line moves fast.  You get nice size portions.  Everything is fresh.  It's very clean and the service is always nice.  I enjoy their buritto bowl over Chipotle.,1,positive
"The avocado tacos are AMAZING.  The veggie fajitas are also pretty good as well.  Really good, solid Mexican place that we go to every time we're in Vegas.",1,positive
"Never had anything but the fajitas here...because they are the best in town!  If you want multiple meats, ask for one pound of meat with half of it beef and half of it chicken (for example).  Cheaper than ordering 1/2 lb of each.  Good service.  Great salsa and salsa con queso.  I repeat, BEST FAJITAS!",1,positive
"I had a great meal at Manuel's!  I ordered their three amigos enchiladas.  This was a great way to try three different enchiladas.  My friends and I went their after and event.  We ate, drank and hung out for hours (while drinking).  The staff was very welcoming and friendly!  Would go back here in a heart beat!",1,positive
"When I need my Carne Asada taco fix, this is my go to place! \n\nAlways friendly, quick, reasonably priced & the quality of their carne asada tacos is right on :) Plus, I like that they don't charge me for extra lime to squeeze onto my tacos, lol",1,positive
Mexican food is one of my favorites so every time I get a chance to eat at a Mexican restaurant I have to try the chimichanga.  This is by far is the best one I have found and I've tried a lot of places!  They also have wonderful tasting enchiladas and tacos.  The food tastes super fresh and you can tell they take the time to prepare their food the right way!,1,positive
"I was pleasantly surprised with this place. We went for lunch. My son loved the complimentary chips and salsa. I ordered the chicken and rice soup for him but ended up eating it myself (he was more interested in the chips). The soup was awesome. I love the avocado, Spanish rice and tomatoes in it. For our meal, I ordered steak fajitas. It came with refried beans, lettuce, rice, tomato, and guacamole. All together it was a tasty meal  After having the soup, I took half of my meal home. Not a bad lunch for less than $10.",1,positive
"I love Mexican food. Especially when it's Real Mexican food and this place is great. Been to a place similar so we tried the al pastor tacos and burrito. So good! All the salsas were great and spicy, also got the Mexican style corn and my boyfriend inhaled it! Can't wait to try the quesadilla, bowl and vampiro, it's far but worth it !",1,positive
"moreno's is cheap and delicious...yummy chicken tacos with cabbage, onion and cilantro...\n\ngo to here",1,positive
"Stopped in here for lunch today, joined by Mark R., Robyn N., Norm R. and Mike C.  It's a little place but stylishly decorated and the prices are very reasonable.  I went with a Chile Relleno Lunch Special, which includes a cheese enchilada and a hard taco and a drink for $5.99, & added Refried Beans & Spanish Rice for $1.99.\n\nEvery bite of this meal was super good & I can't wait to return & try other items from the menu!     :-))",1,positive
"everything on thats a wrap's menu is deliciousness, i promise you can't go wrong with anything you choose and believe me i\""""ve had it all.........\n\nmy faves are...\n7 amigos\nbangkok bowl\nbuffalo 66 with avocado!!\nveggie bowl\n\nand not to mention their employees are real sweeties.",1,positive
"Loco Lime is a favorite, especially with my kids. Kids eat free on Wednesday, and we always ask to sit in Nela's section. She's fantastic and attentive. Try the carnitas tostada (complete with sliced avocado and boiled egg). Good, affordable, convenient food.",1,positive
Three reasons I must have America's every week!\n1. Carne Asada (no matter how they wrap it it's good!)\n2. Possibly the best bottomless chips and salsa in town.\n3. Breakfast burritos. All of them are awesome.,1,positive

"Amigos has some really delicious food! They have a friendly staff and have a variety of food you can choose from.\n\nTheir food is really delicious and I'm not going to say that it is super healthy but you can edit your order to make it healthier if you would like. Their california burrito is really delicious as well has their tacos and other burritos, especially their breakfast burrito. \n\nHighly recommended!",1,positive
"Solid breakfast burritos. Full of flavor, they don't skimp on the meat and potatoes. I also prefer tasting the tortilla and they deliver. My friend enjoyed hers too, but prefers more egg. Great to stop and go grab a quick bite after a hike. No need to feel underdressed...after writing all this a trip to the bathroom changed my feelings about coming here. A backed up, unmaintained rest room *barf* if that's how the public restroom is I can only wonder about the kitchen (where my thoughts go).",0,negative
"I found this place through Yelp and I'm glad I did. It's on the small side and it's super busy but service is quick and the food is good. They really have a variety of things to order from breakfast stuff to quesadillas, to burgers and pitas. For me I gotta have the jalapeno burger which is always cooked perfect. It's hard to find a place that doesn't over cook their burger meat.",1,positive
"Favorites: vegan taco salad wrap (even if you love meat), bacon breakfast burrito, the breakfast sandwich with avocado and onion, butterscotch and Spanish lattes! There's so much good stuff here :)",1,positive
"my go to mexican restaurant now!  inexpensive and delicious!  everything is very fresh and well prepared.  I typically get the chicken taco with their homemade tortilla, the bean tostada, and the ceviche tostada.  their ceviche is the best I have had in the city.  not to mention their salsa is always fresh, a little hot, and very good with the free chips.  ummmmm!!!",1,positive
"We've always loved Caf\u00e9 Rio.  I always order the same thing because it's so good, but I'm sure the rest of their menu is good too.  Oh, it's the pork tacos.  They're terrific!",1,positive
I like Pepin's ..a favorite of me and my boyfriend. His family is form Argentina and the food is very good. Obviously every dish is a little different we have been in at least 7 or 8 times and never disappointed. We have had good consistent service..no issues if we share an app or desert..they are great about doggie bags and are attentive and have a passion for their food. Here is the deal..there is always the purist out there that the food will not live up to ..that's okay..just do not rule this place out...,1,positive
"I like all the filibertos and eat at them frequently. They have great breakfast burritos! However, this location seems to be better than most for lunch. I am never disappointed here. It's fun to play mistery burrito. They have all these burritos named for different southwestern states and it's not posted what  the ingredients are. Everytime I order one it's a delicious surprise. I love me some Fili-B's",1,positive
"Let me tell you, fish taco wrap. You will not be disappointed. And try the waffle fries with a side of their mustard (you can't miss it because it is mentioned on almost every page of the menu)! That mustard was amazing with the fries. I want to go back soon!",1,positive
The steak pita is delicious.  The meat is so tender and seasoned well.  It has a really great diced cucumber and tomato mixture with feta-MMMM yum.  It comes with fries which is kinda weird but they are good.  I also really like the Feta salad (super tasty dressing) and add a steak skewer.   The owner is almost always there and is very friendly too.,1,positive
The carne asada fries are great and they give you a ton of meat for just $6 you can't go wrong just add some of the fresh hot sauce from the salsa bar and your good to go.,1,positive
"Really like their sausage breakfast burrito and nachos.  My husband loves their carne asada nachos.  Good service, good food, reasonable prices too.",1,positive
I finally decided to try this place and it was well worth it. I had their super nachos and breakfast burrito. Both were very good!! The food wasn't greasy and their tortillas are the best around-not dry and flaky but moist and tasty!!! Give them a try!!!!,1,positive
"The lomito completo is officially my favorite sandwich. If you're up for a new adventure try the blood sausage and sweetbreads. Very good. I've tried the ham and cheese and the corn empanadas. Both were excelllent. Service is quick and friendly. They close at 9:30, so get there early.",1,positive
"Tortas Paquime is absolutely, irrefutably delicious, plain and simple.\n\nI seem to always end up getting the Cubano (ham, pork, beans, swiss, avacado, mustard, plus tons of other good stuff) but all their tortas are fantastic.  Great horchata and mango juice too!  And their ice cream is outstanding, not to mention all the mexican sweetbreads available from the bakery section.  This place leaves me full and happy every single time.",1,positive
"I'm a huge fan of the veggie burro it's got these super yummy mushrooms in it!  They also have a great mushroom and pepper taco.  Always happy to see places with some vegetarian representation!    \n\nService is always quick and friendly even when it's packed.  \n\nYou'll definitely pay a little more then regular fast food, but this like Chipotle is so much better then regular fast food.",1,positive
"Drive thru Roberto's !!! I love their bean and cheese burrito... But those spicy pickled carrots is what I think makes it the best! I could eat those carrots all day, every day!!!!! Roberto's for life!!!",1,positive
"I love the bean and cheese burritos. The beans don't have lard, and are always fresh. The tortilla is amazing. Super friendly service too. Big portions for the low prices.",1,positive
"Chili's is one of my favorite restaurants.  It is casual and relatively inexpensive and there is usually little to no wait time.  The staff is always very friendly and the food comes out very quickly.  My favorite dish is the Quesadilla Explosion Salad, but i have honestly never eaten a bad meal here.  This is a place my family and I tend to frequent, and I definitely recommend it!",1,positive
We frequent this place often enough to have tried several of the menu items. All have been awesome! The manager is super friendly every time we have gone in and plus military gets free drinks! Way to go Fredericos!  Breakfast burritos rock too so go in the morning too or order one any other tine as the menu is available all day which is nice.,1,positive
"We love this place. We have been through the drive-thu so many times.  We always get the veggie burro, fries, and the taco combo. The burro is giant; filled with beans, rice, guacamole, lettuce, tomatoes, and onions.  They have crinkle fries.\n\nWe love Erikbertos.",1,positive
"For a fast food place, they have very good fish tacos here. Try the fish burrito, I know it doesn't sound very good but trust me it is excellent. They have menus that tell you the nutritional value of every meal they make.",1,positive
Try the Habanero Wings. They are great! Quick service. Great computer system to follow order.,1,positive
"Macayo's has been one of my faves for over 30 years. I was served a green corn tamale with the Baja sauce by mistake 25 years ago and it has been an addiction ever since.\n\nDine in or take out, it's good food. Give the Baja sauce a try.",1,positive
"Its Del Taco.  \nBetter than Taco Bell by far, and really good.\n\nThis location in particular, is awesome.  They are always fairly quick, and have never messed up an order...and we do a lot of \""""special\"""" things, like \""""no special sauce\"""" on one taco, and sour cream on another...\n\nI love the value menus...this is a great location.",1,positive
"I love Baja Miguel's for lunch.  They have a lunch special for $8.95, which consists of two items, beans and rice, fideo soup, and a margarita (or substitute drink).  Since I am usually here during my work lunch break, I get a virgin margarita, which is still delicious.  They also bring out chips and dip pretty much as soon as you sit down.",1,positive
"The shawerma pita is amazing. The meat is well-cooked and very flavorful and the pita itself is always soft and delicious but sturdy enough to hold everything together. \n\nOh and the owner gave me an on-the-house lemonade while I waited. This alone would bring me back, plus the lemonade is probably the best I've ever had.",1,positive
This has been my favorite breakfast place for maybe 2 years? I live the French toast a lot of my friends get the huervos rancheros. \n\nFor lunch my favorite is the chicken-Roma sand which. If you ask what the most popular lunch is they're likely to say this. Everything here is great though- and healthy!\n\nThe smoothies are bomb too!,1,positive
"My friend showed me this place. This is why we Yelp because I would have never found this place. Great little Mexican that is about as close to the real thing as you can get. I loved everything I've had but the green chile pork burrito is killer, try it enchilada style.",1,positive
It's mainly  the cilantro mousse that keeps me coming back to Padre's or perhaps the black bean soup and the pesto pasta.  Decent sangria and margaritas and consistently good service.  There seems to be something for everyone's tastes on the menu - I've taken picky eaters here a few times and they have always been happy.,1,positive
Just get the Cubano - it is the best I have ever had.  This $5.50 sandwich is worth all of $12.00 and so good....it's also huge!!!,1,positive
"Since the bf likes taco bell we usually go to this one or one of the others by our apartment. The employees are super nice, the food is always yummy, and its fast!\n\nIts your run of the mill Taco Bell, we go here since the drive thru is open late : )",1,positive
"I love Chili's. This is yet my favorite restaurant. Every time I come the food is delicious. Especially the Chicken Nachos, MY FAV!! always eat as an appetizer. and also if you sign up for e-mails, you get awesome coupons! Always use it, either a free appetizer or dessert.\n\nOHMYGOSH! the Skillet Chocolate Chip Cookie, have to eat every time I go! Its beyond delicious! \n\nThis restaurant never disappoints me :)",1,positive
"Chipotle is the best! Get the burrito bowl, with lots of toppings. And if you like spicy, you can't live without the Smokey Chipotle Tabasco sause on top!",1,positive
I love the deep fried potato taco and Grilled Fish Tostada bowl (no tostada)!  Chronic Cantina is fast and delicious and located just up the street from my office.  The staff is always super cool and helpful.,1,positive
Just get the Cubano - it is the best I have ever had.  This $5.50 sandwich is worth all of $12.00 and so good....it's also huge!!!,1,positive
"We like to stay at Mirage when we are in Las Vegas - so eating at Cravings is convenient... fortunately for me, I also like it.\n\nFor $20 they provide a great selection of food choices.  Including Mexican, Asian, Seafood and American.  Its a good deal considering there is a lot of options and the quality of food is pretty good.",1,positive
Any place that offers vegetarian tacos that utilizes chef choice vegetables laid over hand made tortillas wins!! The tacos were remarkable in flavor and the prices were excellent!!,1,positive
"When we want to get our Mexican Restaurant fix, it's Chapala's that we head for.  It's tasty and reasonably priced Mexican food, and the waiters are really good.  One item you may want to try is their garlic shrimp dish. I'm also partial to their Grandpa Tostada.  Yummy!",1,positive
"Originally being from Ft. Worth, I completely appreciate the food at Casa Rita's - authentic TexMex in the tradition of the Mexican Inn. It has been open a little less than a year but it good. I love and miss brisket and I can get my fix here with their enchiladas and tacos.\n\nIf you get a chance to try it, get a side of the spicy slaw. It is a good bit spicy but it's great on the soft tacos or just as a side. House made salsa also makes this place an up and coming gem in town.",1,positive
"Mendozas is great! It may not be the best mexican food in the world, or even the city, but it is authentic and quick and great for a lunch out from the office. The chorizo tacos are awesome.\n\nIts super tiny and a little cramped but it has charm and the owner is great.",1,positive
"This place was a hidden surprise, in a good way.  Tucked way back in a strip mall (isn't that always the case?) it offered a counter ordered meal with server delivered food.  Nothing fancy, but more full-plate style tex-mex beyond the typical burritos and tacos at places like Chipotle.\n\nThe portions were huge and they get bonus points for self-serve salsa and pico de gallo with a nice variety of flavors and levels of heat.",1,positive
Love their breakfast burrito and chorizo burritos. Always go through the drive thru on my way to work. 2 meals easily as they are huge and the price is cheap!,1,positive
"If you are craving Mexican food at 3 in the morning, this place is for you.\n\nHoly Taco Tuesday.  Who can say no to a delicious chicken or beef taco for a dollar?\nHorchata is also a sugar-overdose of a wonderland.   \n\nThey also have the best breakfast burritos.  Hands down.  Eggs, bacon, extra cheese & pico.   They will put ANYTHING into your burrito.  Just ask.\n\nI've heard a lot of things about the Super Nachos but I cannot find it in my heart to order them.\n\nMake sure to extra red sauce all of the things.",1,positive
"We go to Carlitos at least once a month for New Mexican food. The stuffed sopapillas are my favorite, and my boyfriend always gets a Carlitos Burrito (double meat) smothered in red chile. I always order a sopapilla on the side so I can eat it with honey at the end of the meal. The only thing I have had here that I think could use some improvement is their calabacitas. I would love to see them add fideo to the menu at some point too.",1,positive
"Rotisserie Mile End, where to start. I had a whole chicken portuguese style, it was tasty but dry. Overall good but had better at Romados.\n\nHad an entree of calamari but what a surprise, for 6$+ only had one small piece. I only noticed when I got home, because I ordered to takeout. \n\nWill not go back,  for 28$ that I paid for the chicken an calamari and can get better value and quality at Romados or even St-hubert chicken.",0,negative

Five Star Food!!! -hidden under Esplanade Theater the chips & salsa will blow your mind and are a fabulous way to prepare you for what's about to hit your pallet when your order arrives!!! -ITS A MUST DO!,1,positive
Best Carne Asada in the Valley!!!!! Every thing is fresh. They will even modify your meal to gluten free!,1,positive
"Sopes Pastor, yum.\n\nTotally delicious marinated pork with Mexican cheese, lettuce, tomato and avocado. Very filling for $3.50. Mango Jarritos soda, a real treat. Next time I will eat a burrito. Looked large and the one sopes was plenty.\n\nRustic but comfortable. Mexican TV in the background. Restaurant portion of store hidden in the back.  Tricky strip mall to find. Worth the effort.\n5 star food, 4 star ambiance and service.",1,positive
"Cowboy Ciao has a great selection of American Foods, with the Chopped Salad being a weekly craving of mine.  The wine selection couples well with their menu and the flights are a great way to go if your just stopping in for a night cap.",1,positive
"This place is great.   The menu is always changing, and I've never been disappointed.  The dogs, fries, tacos, sandwiches... everything is top-notch!",1,positive
"I had the Banderita  burrito and it was amazing, a party for my mouth. The best chile roja EVER! I've never been disappointed with Ricardo's. The carnitas torta is scrumptious, too. It gets crowded at lunch but you'll be able to find a seat.\nTry it! If you enjoy authentic Mexican food, you'll love this. The salsa bar has some fabby sides, my fave is the onions. They're brown, saut\u00e9ed a little, very tasty. Remember: you're going for the food, not the ambiance.\nIt's about the art of food cooked with passion!",1,positive
"My friend showed me this place. This is why we Yelp because I would have never found this place. Great little Mexican that is about as close to the real thing as you can get. I loved everything I've had but the green chile pork burrito is killer, try it enchilada style.",1,positive
"Habanero salsa was delicious, the service was fast and friendly and not a busy place so we could sit and eat comfortably! Also, huge portions for the quesadillas and burritos.",1,positive
"I've liked burrito express because they've always had cheap food and delivered. They increased the min delivery from $10 to $15 and also recently increased the prices on their menu. They have also removed many items from the menu and they will still make them for you at a more expensive price. Burrito express was my hangover spot for breakfast, but I probably won't be coming here anymore.",0,negative
"Can never go wrong coming here to fulfill the drunchies! With an assortment of sandwiches, I always find myself grabbing their Chipotle Chicken Avocado sandwich! \n\nMy friend isn't such a fan of the chipotle sauce and recently asked if she could replace it with ranch instead. They were completely understanding and replaced the sauce with her request. Just in case some people are wondering if they can substitute something! \n\nIt's always a great place to try and I'm sure you will not be disappointed!",1,positive
"Gave Cafe Rio a try after a friend recommended it. Tried the steak burrito enchilada style and two tacos: chicken and pork barbacoa, and ordered chips and salsa. \n\nThe steak burrito was quite good. The tacos, however, weren't. The pork was way too sweet for my liking and the chicken was far too bland. The chips were ok, one of the salsa was heavily flavored with lime, to the point it was inedible. The other was decent.\n\nPhotos are posted.",0,negative
"I don't normally say things are the best but these are the best fajitas I've ever had. Chips are perfect,salsa is perfect, bean dip is perfect, and the best fried ice cream I've ever had. Plus the service is great.",1,positive
I love their chips and salsa (I buy their chips at the store all the time now) and the fajita burrito. But the absolute best part is the lemon-basil margarita. So amazing. We go there regularly for the food and have had excellent food and service each time. We've been to the Monroe and the Verona locations as well and have yet to be disappointed.,1,positive
Love the pesto chicken sandwich and the short rib tacos. Salads are always fresh and the sweet potato chips crisp. Nice selection of fun cocktails. Service is usually very good. Stunning patio when the weather is mild.  Husband loves the Siracha  fried chicken that makes an occasional appearance on the menu. Highly recommend.,1,positive
"This is my default to-go for lunch. I have tried the AZ burrito, veggie burrito, frittata and a few other dishes. Never been disappointed with the taste and quantity. Definitely one of the healthier options out there. The service is excellent. I have dined in but generally use their drive thru to get my lunch. When there is a queue 1-2 staff come out and take your orders. Highly recommended for a quick, healthy and delicious breakfast/ lunch. \n\nThey have protein shakes also - excellent!!",1,positive
"Eleven, the \""""flagship\"""" big burrito restaurant fits in nicely to the big burrito family.  The service is excellent and food superb.\n\nif you want a good meal but can't sit down for an good while or want a cheaper version the bar menu is excellent as well. The bar area is particularly enjoyable during the summer hours with the doors open.",1,positive
"If you're desperate for Mexican food and can't bare to drive any further, then this is your spot. They have a decent menu but the food I ordered was basically flavorless. \n\nGo to Moreno's.",0,negative
"This is my go to Mexican food when eating out. And it's great because they are located EVERYWHERE.  They make all their salsas in house and they are constantly prepping the fresh veggies. They have a free salsa bar for customers. My favorite side condiment is the spicy marinated carrots and cucumber slices on the side.  Prices are very reasonable and proportions are hefty.  There are the more \""""greasy\"""" options, but you can choose to get healthy variations also.",1,positive
A Chipotle even closer to me!  We ordered to go and I noticed that you can even order online. There was no one there probably because no one realizes that it's opened yet but it is!\n\nWe ordered the usual...a chicken burrito and a Barbacoa bowl. They put a bunch of meat in my bowl but not enough rice which is fine. My meat was a bit on the dry side but I'm sure they are still working out the kinks. Overall it's still one of my favorite semi fast food places.,1,positive
"Good fast-food mexican taqueria type food. The bean burrito and rolled tacos are good. I love that now they offer whole wheat tortillas. Their salsa bar is amazing with 3 types of salsa, spicy carrots, onion mix, and fire roasted chiles. Yum.",1,positive
Amazing pan con bistec'steak sanwich' simple and full of flavor. The mojoto regular was okay but the food and service are tops. Great place to venture off the strip.,1,positive
"I really like this place!  The food is so good and fast.  I think the longest we've waited is about 10 minutes to get our food...I would strongly suggest the carne asada plate.  Awesome meat!  There is guacamole on the side, along with rice, beans, and tortillas.  Can't go wrong!  \n\nIt's kind of a random location off of Maryland and Pebble...just look right behind/next to the Shell Station and you'll see it.",1,positive
Sweet pork is really good.  Red sauce is great.  Chips and queso are fav as well.  Location is always busy.,1,positive
Love Ninos!! We visit family every Thanksgiving and we visit Ninos at least twice while we are here. Probably our favorite Mexican restaurant including the ones at home in CA!!!,1,positive
If you haven't tried this place.. It is definitely a MUST! The food is excellent. The place is ALWAYS immaculately clean! You will see the hard workers there mopping the same area 10 times! The staff is amazing! The carne asada fries are delicious! This place makes me feel like I'm at a taco spot in real Mexico! Prepare for a line! But it's well worth it:),1,positive
I really enjoy Fuzzy's for lunch. The shredded pork tacos are delicious. I far prefer this place over Qdoba or Chipotle. The dining experience is far better. They have tons of TV's to watch all the sports your heart desires! They also Serve Mexican Coke which is awesome because they use real sugar. If you feel the need to indulge in an Alcoholic beverage they have those too!  They offer a lot more variety than the typical chain. So give it a try.,1,positive
"It's NOT boring - it's INCREDIBLE!  The Arizona 24 hour Mexican restaurant bean tostada is seriously one of my favorite foods, and Federico's has one of the best.  Add their hot sauce and WOW!  They offer both red and green salsas and just a few drops of each magic liquid make every bite simply outstanding.  You can get a happy mouth and a full belly for just over $2. You've gotta try this place.",1,positive
"Adobo Fried Rice Omelettes are a must when we're in town.  They're just so good and totally hit the spot.  It's a huge omelette filled with minced pork adobo and rice.  Loco Moco, chicken wings, and Manapuas are yummy too.  It's counter service and the restaurant is clean with a good, casual atmosphere.  Place takes credit card.",1,positive
Carne Asada fries! Open 24hrs and never too packed! Minus 1 star cause they got no Mexican Cokes!,1,positive
"This place is BOMBTASTIC! The carne asada is GRILLED to perfection, seasoned well!\n\nIt comes in a Burrito or Torta form.  You can't go wrong as the menu is very specific to only carne asada! Hehehehe.\n\nGo get some!!! Seriously!!",1,positive
"The key to Defalcos is calling IN your order before arriving.  This place is awesome but its SWAMPED at lunch time.  You'll end up eating your lunch for dinner if you dont plan accordingly.  \n\nThey make fresh sandwhiches and salads and I've never had an \""""off\"""" meal there.  Try something Itialian...its what they do best, my favorite its the meatball sub.  Also the antipasto salad ranks right on up there.\n\nIn the grocery section, you'll find specialty items to take home... homemade pastas, spices etc.  Delicious!!",1,positive
Favorite chicken spot of all the chains. The marinade is awesome. Grilled so it feels healthy. The toppings n sauces n salsas are a huge bonus. Their fire grilled corn side is so good!!! Avocado chicken burrito is fantastic. I'm definitely craving el pollo for dinner!!!,1,positive
"Favorites: vegan taco salad wrap (even if you love meat), bacon breakfast burrito, the breakfast sandwich with avocado and onion, butterscotch and Spanish lattes! There's so much good stuff here :)",1,positive
"Everytime i go here I have a great  meal.  Well then again I can't stop ordering the same thing over and over again.  I like to order the gyro picado salad, it comes packed with a lot of gyro meat, great salad with jalapenos.  They have a great variety on their menu, pizza, pitas, picado salads, burgers, etc.  You pretty much can't go wrong with anything you pick on their menu..",1,positive
"Too sad that I've moved away from Roberto's Taco Shop territory. I lived just around the block from this location and hunger pangs were usually cured by Roberto's. I only ever really get one or two things from here when I go, but consistency is what I liked! The meat in the burritos are a little tough sometimes or overcooked, so I hardly get those but Roberto's is my go-to for carne asada fries. Extra cheese and ask for some jalapenos before I drive off and I'm good to go. Best carne asada fries I've had in the valley.",1,positive
The best loco moco - excellent gravy!!  Had the spam musubi which is also very very good.  Will definitely be back to try all the items on their menu!!,1,positive
One of our favorite places to eat is Some Burros....we love the food and never had a bad meal there Great food and atmosphere!!,1,positive
"Miguel's is great.  This may be difficult to locate for people that are randomly looking to stop somewhere, though.  The good is very good tasting tex/mex.  The service is just fine and attentive, I've not experienced any customer service issues here.  They have combos and affordable food if you want something cheap; otherwise there big entrees are good and still not a wallet buster.\n\nI'd recommend this place to anyone on the west side or anyone making the trip South on I-85.",1,positive
"Fresh enchiladas prepared before your very eyes! Warm, soft, tasty tortillas and bith traditional and unusual fillings and toppings, all very tasty. We haven't found anything we don't like here.\nIt's a \""""fast food\"""" model, but very comfortable. Great prices. Easy parking.",1,positive
"I have been a customer at Habanero's since the joint opened. The food is delicious, they have a great menu, and the staff is friendly. \n\nAnother great aspect of Habanero's is that they cater. Their mini-chimis are a great alternative to wings on Superbowl Sunday.\n\nMy personal favorite dish is the buenos nachos. Authentic? Nope, but it's really delicious. Their fish tacos and carne asada burritos are also great.",1,positive
"Chips, salsa and bean dip here are to die for. The food at Serrano's has always been amazing at all locations. The staff is always friendly. The burritos are delicious and fairly priced. Make sure to get them enchilada style.",1,positive
Of the Big Burrito group restaurants Casbah is the one that has never failed us.  Consistent and delicious with great flavors of the mediterrean.  \n\nAll of the dishes are served with great flavors from their pastas to their duck but their signature Arugula salad is a reason in and of itself to visit.  Crisp clean flavors with complex combinations of textures.\n\nSpecial occasions or hungry on a week night... casbah is a great stop,1,positive
"I like coming here for a big, cheap mexican meal. Order the breakfast burrito. Comes with ham or bacon. Ingredients: scrambled eggs, hash browns, tortilla. Its pretty sizable, at least a pound of food. The salsa bar has a choice between the green and the red sauce. \nAt 6 am, theres maybe one or two other patrons so I get to enjoy my meal in silence. The service was friendly too.",1,positive
Plato de asada is great! Food came out about two min after I ordered it. Friendly service. ..\n\nI would defiantly eat here again.,1,positive
Great fresh mex! Love the salmon tacos with a mango salsa. I don't think you can go wrong with anything from Tia Rosas!\n\nThis is a well established restaurant in the valley and has been loved by the locals for years. Always fresh and good.,1,positive
What can I say about Filibertos. It's one of my go to's for lunch. Never been disappointed in their food. Always good and always hot. And plus if you go inside you can get there are avocado salsa. One of my favorites!,1,positive
Great place! The salsa is so good I eat too much of it every time. Pollo con Queso was so good too. Anything that has a pound of cream cheese on it is right by me.,1,positive
"I don't care what anyone says, I love Filiberto's.  Carne asada burrito, Arizona burrito, green chile, carnitas, machaca, chorizo, carne asada fries.... I love it all.  I'm not crazy about the cheese they use, so I usually order without it, or end up scraping it off. It's not gross, they just tend to be heavy handed.\n\nNothing beats a late-night Filiberto's stop, or a morning-after hangover buster.  And, their horchata is my favorite! If they delivered, my life would be complete.",1,positive
"I love America's Carne Asada, it has been rated the best in the valley several times and I can see why. My co-workers and I eat there at least once a week. Spring for the XL burrito extra spicy! Like others have said parking can be a bit of a pain during lunch but it isn't horrible, you can park on the street. $12 for a XL burrito and tamarindo drink is a little expensive compared to your chain fast food joint but this food is WAY better! So worth it!",1,positive
"Macayo's has been one of my faves for over 30 years. I was served a green corn tamale with the Baja sauce by mistake 25 years ago and it has been an addiction ever since.\n\nDine in or take out, it's good food. Give the Baja sauce a try.",1,positive
"First time at Carlito's and was worth the 20 minute drive. I had a chicken and black bean burrito smothered with green chile sauce. I added jalapenos, lettuce, onions and cilantro to it. They were quite generous with the green chile and the sauce was so tasty.  Also ordered the sides of rice, retried beans and the sopapilla.  The rice and beans were okay, but the sopapilla had me at the first bite. It was piping hot and we drizzled it with honey and it was amazingly delicious. Can't wait to go back and eat again.",1,positive
"I was very impressed with Mariscos Culiacan!\n\nThis AUTHENTIC Mexican food/seafood, not just another knock off Filibertos.  I had a Pescado Entero (Whole Fish, Fried), and it was fantastic!  My brother had the Carne Asada Plate, and I can say that the meat was actually grilled, not pan fried like so many places.  I would highly recommend it!",1,positive
Tried the dominicano and was really impressed. I found it to be full of flavor and very filling. I definitely look forward to going back and trying more. The only downside was the wait time for the food but staff was very helpful and polite. Will definitely be back soon!,1,positive
I really like Emilianos.  The chile relleno is great as is the tortilla soup and I LOVE the sangria!!!,1,positive
"Can't go wrong with senor taco. This place is great. Haven't had one bad thing. Try the carnitas burrito, or fish tacos....yum.",1,positive
The carne asada fries are great and they give you a ton of meat for just $6 you can't go wrong just add some of the fresh hot sauce from the salsa bar and your good to go.,1,positive
"Amigos has some really delicious food! They have a friendly staff and have a variety of food you can choose from.\n\nTheir food is really delicious and I'm not going to say that it is super healthy but you can edit your order to make it healthier if you would like. Their california burrito is really delicious as well has their tacos and other burritos, especially their breakfast burrito. \n\nHighly recommended!",1,positive
I really enjoy Fuzzy's for lunch. The shredded pork tacos are delicious. I far prefer this place over Qdoba or Chipotle. The dining experience is far better. They have tons of TV's to watch all the sports your heart desires! They also Serve Mexican Coke which is awesome because they use real sugar. If you feel the need to indulge in an Alcoholic beverage they have those too!  They offer a lot more variety than the typical chain. So give it a try.,1,positive
Amazing food from beginning to end. Don't miss the quinoa stuffed avocado. The Classic Saltado is scrumptious! Great kids menu too :),1,positive
"Good, quality, inexpensive Mexican food!!!! \n\nA friend recommended Senor Taco to us a while ago and we've been coming here ever since.  All of the employees are friendly and helpful. You can order at their busy drive-thru, or stop in and order at the counter. Their fresh salsa bar is amazing \n\nAnd, they have a Happy Hour where many items are half price! \n\nJust go already, enjoy!",1,positive
Found this spot and it was well worth it! The carnitas de Jalisco were excellent!!!! They were cooked just right. The flour tortillas are homemade. The service and staff were fast and friendly.,1,positive
I just finished a green chilie pork burrito from New Mexican Grill.  First time I have been.  It was absolutely delicious!!!  The owner was very friendly and welcoming; he explained all about his food and what set it apart. They prepare the food in front of you so there is no mystery there.  Can't wait to go back and try their breakfast burritos!    Hooray for great Mexican food in Gilbert!,1,positive
I know I gave Roberto's 5 stars but Fausto's is way better. They are just a lot farther away from my house. I love their carne asada and chips and cheese. Great place for a quick bite of tasty and blessedly unhealthy Mexican food.,1,positive
We frequent this place often enough to have tried several of the menu items. All have been awesome! The manager is super friendly every time we have gone in and plus military gets free drinks! Way to go Fredericos!  Breakfast burritos rock too so go in the morning too or order one any other tine as the menu is available all day which is nice.,1,positive

"I haven't found a Mexican restaurant that compares yet. \n\nSalsas are hot, so be sure you have your water before you indulge. My favorite is the hot green, but they offer 4 varieties of salsas. \n\nThe shredded beef is good. The chicken is always good - all white meat! The ground beef is yummy too, but not my first choice. \n\nMy favorites are the enchiladas, the taco salad and also the tacos. \n\nA weekly craving! And the best happy hour around, as it is daily from the late afternoon until 7pm.",1,positive
Had the CC Sizzle nacho style dude it's great. Going back soon! The cheese is so great. Rice is fresh & so are the beans. I love fresh homemade style. My new favorite place. Go here & fall in love,1,positive
they have the best soup. tge salsa is amazing. toasted and roasted and whatnot. i like the taco and soup combo. he likes the coastal trio. yum!!!,1,positive
"this is one of those places that you can not eat at every day but it is an amazing morning after a long night meal. I moved from Northern Cali so our go to heart stopper was Carolinas. So when I moved into this neighborhood and saw that we had a Roberto's it was a must try. I tried the Carne Asada burrito the first time and was happy with the choice. We have also tried out the super nachos, taco's, and carne asada fries. This place is a must if you are in need of a hangover or savere hunger pain reliever.",1,positive

"When it comes to mexican \""""fast food\"""" this is my spot. I am a huge fan of their carne asada burritos, comes heaped with meat, pico de gallo and guacamole. OM NOM NOM!!! Haven't had a bad thing from this place yet. Love their salsa bar with all the extra goodies. Never disappointed by this joint.",1,positive
"Tried this place while visiting Phoenix for work.\n\nGreat spot for lunch. I got the chorizo burrito enchilada style. It was huge, but ingredients were so flavorful I had to clean my plate.\n\nPrice was a bargain and the owner even gave me one of their famous empanadas to go since it was my first time visiting.\n\nI highly recommend.",1,positive
"We had our local \""""Lunch Club here on Wednesday and everyone had the Taco Buffet. I was surprized when I saw all the other items in the buffet. I tried a little of everything and loved it all. They have a nice side room if you want to hold a meeting or event like we did. The service was prompt and they handled our group of 35+ without a hitch. Thanks, We'll be back often!!",1,positive
"I don't normally say things are the best but these are the best fajitas I've ever had. Chips are perfect,salsa is perfect, bean dip is perfect, and the best fried ice cream I've ever had. Plus the service is great.",1,positive
"When it comes to quick, reasonably priced Mexican food that's open 24-hours, only Roberto's Taco shop comes to mind. There are quite a few locations all over town but this one happens to be the closest one to me. Some of my favorites include the California burrito, carne asada fries and breakfast burritos!\n\nGood times for Roberto's.... or shall I say buenos tiempos!",1,positive

"I had the Pollo Torta...and for $7, it is an insanely large sandwich with mounds of fresh chicken and delicious condiments (like the black bean spread or the fresh cabbage).  You've gotta ask for the \""""avocado crema\"""" to be added to whatever you order!  I was thoroughly satisfied, and am excited about its great location downtown!",1,positive

"Top notch breakfast burrito. All ingredients are fresh; they also don't follow the trend of other places by using tons of potato filler in there. I tried the machaca breakfast burrito - it's got peppers, tomato, green chile, cheese, egg and potato. Great mix, piping hot, and huge. For around $4. I could probably split it and still be full. I will be back regularly for this quick stop. Next time I'll try the chorizo - they make it themselves and claim it's lean and not greasy.",1,positive
Tried this place based on a friends recommendation and yelp reviews. This is a place that holds true to its reviews. It is located inside a gas station. The portions are huge and the food is delicious. We ordered carne asada nachos and chicken tortas. Both were amazing! I would definitely come here again! Move over Robertos. My new favorite mexican joint. Oh and the tortilla chips are the freshest I've ever had! They are cooked to order!! I don't know how many restaurants can say that.,1,positive
"Mexican food doesn't get much better than this. The fish tacos and shrimp burrito are both amazing as is everything else my husband and I have tried.  Caminero's is delicious, affordable, and quick.",1,positive
"A bean burrito can be the true measure of a Mexican restaurant. A simple concoction, yes - but an establishment that takes the time to make really great tasting beans and wrap them in a great tortilla - is my kind of place. Los Favoritos makes a stellar bean burrito, as well as an outstanding Carne Asada burrito. Others I've gone with have liked their food very much as well, but I haven't been able to get past those burritos. Great green and red salsa in squeeze bottles. Definitely a go-to place for fast (but good) food.",1,positive
"I ate their tacos twice in one day last week and enjoyed some today. Not for the weak of heart and it's nothing like Mad Mex. Real tacos, real Mexicans, really good. They're only a couple bucks a taco so if you haven't gone than you're a toy. Also a grocery store which has a really awesome selection of latino foods.",1,positive
I've tried a half dozen or so Mexican/Tex-Mex places in Glendale and this is so far the best I've found by far.,1,positive
Everything here is amazing.  The menu is healthy and extremely creative at the same time.  Faves right now are green lemonade smoothie and traditional breakfast burrito with chicken sausage and chipotle aioli.,1,positive
"Pollo Con Crema is very good, I hear consistently. I personally enjoy their enchiladas and the salsa that comes with chips definitely has a kick - thumbs up. I find service almost always attentive.",1,positive
"Endless enchiladas are a good deal. My daughter loves the tortillas. Though not amazingly authentic, the food is good, and the restaurant is nice and clean.  Untold this is the last day for endless enchiladas though.",1,positive
"Salsarita's is a regular stop for me and the kids.  We all get the kids meals.  For me, that is all the food I can eat (or rather, that I need to eat).  The meal comes with a hard or soft taco with chicken or beef and fixin's of your choice, chips, a cookie, and a small drink.  All for less than $5!  Service is fast so if you're starving, you won't have a long wait to fill your tummy.  Salsarita's also has food to go for large parties - great for when unexpected guests arrive.",1,positive
"If you need some delicious authentic Mexican food Pepe's is the place for you.\n\nThe Carnitas de Puerco, slow roasted pork in their delicious green sauce is out of this world. The Enchiladas de Pollo con Mole is fantastic too! It seems that if you close your eyes and point you will be rewarded with something incredibly yummy.\n\nIf you are tired of the same old chimichangas and the like head over to Pepe's for a taste of Mexico.",1,positive
"Never had anything but the fajitas here...because they are the best in town!  If you want multiple meats, ask for one pound of meat with half of it beef and half of it chicken (for example).  Cheaper than ordering 1/2 lb of each.  Good service.  Great salsa and salsa con queso.  I repeat, BEST FAJITAS!",1,positive
"Have been checking out the local trucks recently, of the 5 I have tried\nthis is the best. Creative menu, well seasoned, and I second Chester's\nthought on the shawarma, and the prices seem better than the others.\n\nI finished my shawarma, and started to drive away, it was so good I drove a few blocks\nback to get another..... can't remember the last time I did that....",1,positive
This is our go-to for take out mexican food.\nGreat prices and really good food.\nI order my son the baby plate for less than $2 and he gets a heap of rice and beans and some shredded chicken.\nI love the chicken taco with a ton of salsa.\nHubby is a green chili kind of guy and always gets a green chili burro.\nFresh chips are an added bonus even though you do have to pay extra for them.\nThe refried beans do have lard so we always order the whole beans and they are excellent.,1,positive

I lucked out finding Tortas El Rey. The food is always fresh and delicious and the staff is friendly.  I suggest the chicken quesadilla. It is served with beans and guacamole inside the quesadilla and is awesome.,1,positive
"I'm a big fan of Cantina 1511! The food is delicious, the staff is attentive, and the prices aren't too shabby. The guacamole is made fresh right in front of you which I'm a huge fan of. It is a about $10 so I would say it's good to share with others since you will have plenty of leftovers. I would definitly recommend this place.",1,positive

"I first discovered 86d Eats at the fresh52 farmer's market outside of Whole Foods. I love hummus so I sampled some of their pesto hummus and was immediately delighted.\n\nThe tzatziki and salsa are also delightful, and they have a deal where if you buy three dips you get a bag of pita for free. I've since seen them at the Spring's Preserve farmer's market, and their dips are as delicious as ever.",1,positive
"Stopped in here for lunch today, joined by Mark R., Robyn N., Norm R. and Mike C.  It's a little place but stylishly decorated and the prices are very reasonable.  I went with a Chile Relleno Lunch Special, which includes a cheese enchilada and a hard taco and a drink for $5.99, & added Refried Beans & Spanish Rice for $1.99.\n\nEvery bite of this meal was super good & I can't wait to return & try other items from the menu!     :-))",1,positive
"Carlitos, New Mexico style. Slightly hot sauces, but oh, what flavor!  Recommend the burritos (any) chicken enchiladas and the pork, very tender!  Ask for Joe's Special. Maybe you shouldn't go there, I don't want to be waiting for a table. :-)",1,positive

"Las Fuentes has the best Mexican food in Surprise! Very nice staff as well. We eat here at least once a month and we are never disappointed. Portions are huge! The prices are so reasonable and the food is delicious! My favorites are their shrimp Caesar salad, shrimp al mojo de ajo, any burrito and we always enjoy their buffet as well.",1,positive
Costa Vida has great food. Their sweet pork salads are my favorite. I do think some of their items are a little pricey but overall we keep going back for more. Great lunch or dinner spot!,1,positive
"I love Costa Vida. Their salads are delicious, it must be the fresh tortillas that are layered on the bottom.Customer service is great and the food is consistently good. My only issue with this restaurant is when you are nickel and dimed for things like sour cream, extra dressing, etc...I'm not a fan of that. But the pros outweigh the cons and I will continue to eat here.",1,positive
Great fresh mex! Love the salmon tacos with a mango salsa. I don't think you can go wrong with anything from Tia Rosas!\n\nThis is a well established restaurant in the valley and has been loved by the locals for years. Always fresh and good.,1,positive
"i've been raised on macayo's so i maaaayyyy be a little biased, but i really enjoy their chips and salsa and anything they put the baja sauce on.  the enchiladas are also really good and the cheese crisp is (usually) perfect.  i've never had an issue with service at this location that was noticeable one way or another.  my favorite macayos is still the one on 19th ave and thunderbird, but this one is a close second.",1,positive
Serrano's is on of my most favorite restaurants of all time.  I go at least once a week.   Chips and Salsa are Great! As well as the service and food.  I would suggest sitting in the lounge/bar area. It's nice and quiet and the servers are fabulous.,1,positive
"I haven't been to Ritos in ages but I had to try my favs..red mix enchilada style with a side of rice and beans! The beans are the best in town! So flavorful! Red chili is spicy but not overwhelming. The rice is tasty all by itself but mix it with their hot sauce and you'll have a party in your mouth! I ordered two beef tacos..two words, de lish! Hot pulled beef with lettuce and cheese and put the hot sauce on and you're in Mex food heaven! Bring your cash and your friends! This place will not disappoint you!",1,positive
"BEWARE!! Read my first review, my laptop was stolen.\n\nLuckily I had a program (Dropbox) on there, and was able to track it down with the help of LVPD.\n\nIt was found that the lady who stole the laptop was actually a maid from the Palms hotel!!! Unbelievable!!!\n\nDONT STAY THERE!!! They will steal your stuff and then accuse you of fabricating this story.",0,negative

"The corporation as a whole is a joke, they don't even care about their loyalty customer,s, bad rooms, horrible prices, this hotel is definitely a dinosaur in the industry.

This is a very nice hotel with excellent service.  I am a fan. I would not hesitate to return any time.\n\nThe pool is small but my kids loved it.,1,positive
DON'T STAY HERE. As soon as you walk into this hotel it has an awful smell. I booked this hotel because it was close to training I was attending. I should of known something wasn't right with such low room rates. The hotel and rooms are very dirty and the carpets looked like they haven't been replaced in years. They should close down this hotel completely to do the renovation.,0,negative
I would consider giving this place another star or two but first impressions last a lifetime! Upon check in me and my wife dealt with the most rude person I encountered on our vacation.  I'm not sure if he just really hated his job or just hates life in general. Either way he is not the type of person you want dealing with paying guests upon arrival.  We learned our lesson on you get what you pay for.,0,negative
"Zero stars for this one please... We wasted our money for a salty place. I mean the sushi is not fresh and everything else taste like it's not newly cooked. I'm sorry Luxor. Your hotel is nice, service is good but you need to work on your food. Nasty!",0,negative
"I been to delhi palace. The service guys and manager have no sense of manners. When we are in middle of our lunch or dinner, he brings bill and waits there to pay. When serving water, they have no manners. They spill all over the table and don't even tell sorry or clean. This is the worst hotel i have seen here which has this bad service.\n\nFood is not that great. It is ok.",0,negative
"Rooms are nice, but food and bar service is very very slow and takes forever! Will not order or eat here again.",0,negative
"This place is so overrated. The service is awful -- they were so rude to my girlfriend that she was crying by the time my flight landed. The decor, food, etc. are nothing special either. Our room was large. That's the only good thing I can saw about the place. I'd never stay here again.",0,negative
"The staff at the Riviera is VERY rude! A couple of staff members started talking about my family and I in front of our faces just because we had asked, earlier, if there were any rooms available. RIDICULOUS! Not only did they have bad attitudes, but they kept us waiting for about an hour until we got our room. Also, the restaurant inside the hotel has very poor quality food. If I could rate this hotel less than one I would.",0,negative
"Several issues with this place. First, I had to lug my baggage up to the 3rd floor of my \""""casita\"""". Then the bathroom looks unclean and out dated. The tv remote was out of batteries and it took them 2 hours to come up. The alarm clock would not keep the right time and was frozen at the same time. I then tried to call down for a wake up call and the buttons on the phone for the front desk were not working. Had to call with my cell phone and wait through the lengthy outgoing message and transfers.\nWould not come back..",0,negative

OMG this please is not even worth it The room smelled like smoke so bad and just think we paid in advance for 5 day's and i was pissed then once we checked in they informed us we had to pay a another fee of $10 a day surcharge I was so done with this hotel and was ready to check out as soon as i saw the room Do Not go in the pool it was so dirty you could see it from the side walk   GOOD LUCK,0,negative
DO NOT BOOK THIS MOTEL.  Do not book thru expedia either.  You will not get a refund.  This place is the most disgusting motel I have ever even been to.  The people around the place look like they live in it and I don't think it's safe.  WOW the only thing that must keep this place running is people booking it and not staying and you get NO refund.  BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,0,negative
The hotel is dirty and run down.  The hotel was overbooked and could not accomodate our request for 2 beds despite having 3 people in the room and were in no way apologetic.  The front desk staff was unhelpful and very snotty. No fridge.  Not even a coffee maker in the room.  The casino seemed much smokier than all the others. Would not stay here again,0,negative

"was beyond disappointed. Friendly check in but the room was a small box of a room, the view was nonexistant, the shower had no water pressure, couldnt get decent reception much less my wifi on my cell, and to top it off when i asked for a receipt i was not given one. \""""we dont offer a receipt if nothing has been billed\"""" but yet charged me 50 as a resort deposit.  What resort??? All they have is a lonely starbucks and a lackluster pool. Id rather stay in the bates motel then stay here ever again!",0,negative
"I don't think this hotel is the best but I thought it was nice and cozy. I do not see it as a problem. For the price I paid for. I am ok with it. If it was in a brand new condition, I would pay way more than I did for 4 nights. Very close by to places. I cannot complain.",1,positive
"Do not stay here. Bad restaurants, old small room, bad customer service. Nothing here is worth $300/ night during memorial holiday weekend. Except the location and the exterior.

"This place sucks!\nI have never tried something so bad before in my entire life!\nThe service was bad and the employees was mad and pretty irritable.\nMy first room was next to the icemachine so I couldn't here my own thoughts! \nSo I went back to the lobby and got another room. \nMy last room was also pretty bad!\nThe A/C didn't work, which was a huge problem because it was 110 Fahrenheit outside!\n\nDon't stay at this hotel!!!!",0,negative
1.5 stars ... Definitely a hotel from the past here.  Time to implode and redo this place.  \n\nThe bad thing (for inexperienced travelers) is that Expedia and others give this place 3 stars.,0,negative
"Booked this hotel as a last resort before reading the reviews on yelp.  All are believable after seeing the place.  My advice, sleep in your rental car.  Photos I added are of my room which was the nicest of the 5 rooms I booked.  Others had really old worn carpet, random pieces of furniture.   Outside the paint was peeling everywhere the signs that say \""""not responsible for damaged or stolen cars.\"""" were reassuring.",0,negative
"I was scheduled to stay at this hotel for a month and one week into my stay I could not stand it and moved to a different hotel.  Location is a little bit rough, dinner is only provided 3 nights a week (most residence inns provide 4 nights), THEY DO NOT HAVE HIGH SPEED INTERNET (MISLEADING ADVERTISING), workout facility is lacking proper equipment, I had many problems with my key card accessing doors, and it is quite noisy due to interstate 17 in front of the hotel.",0,negative
"I was not really impressed about this hotel! My first time in Days Inn with my family. Realy this hotel is on the older side, the rooms are small.

The hotel is in downtown Charlotte and is with an area of night clubs with loud outdoor music.  Was in town for Business and was not able to sleep for two nights due to loud banks in the area.\nThe rooms and halls smell MUSTY and DAMP!!\nThe menu for the restaurant/lounge needs some updating.  There is LIMITED items for those looking for a healthy diet.\nWill not be my choice for future stays in Charlotte.,0,negative
"Don't waste your money here. Especially on a cabana. Once you hit the amount you have to spend ($300 minimum) they kick you out. It was our friends birthday and we planned on celebrating all night but instead service was horrible and we were asked to leave once we spent $300. When asked for a detailed transaction receipt, our server said \""""Seriously?\"""". I will never go back and I'll make sure my friends never go there. I didn't even want to give them a star rating. Hate this place.",0,negative
"No. Don't do it. The motels next door are nicer. Went in, nobody was at the front desk. The lady stumbled in from outside. The lobby was hot and muggy. The room, even more so, not to mention the smell. It was rough. It's clearly run down and in need of major work. Fortunately, I got my money back.",0,negative
"This hotel is terrible!  There are 3 floors - the third being half smoking/half not, but all smell.  So I was put on the 2nd floor.  There is absolutely no sound proofing in the ceiling, so you \""""feel\"""" the vibration of people walking across the room above you, and if there happens to be a family with kids put above you then even the walls shake.  The stairway carpeting is disgusting.  I am unfortunate because I am working short term here and my company stuck me here, but if you have a choice, don't do it.",0,negative
This place is a real dump. Glad I changed to the other Travelodge close to MGM rather than this one. The staff was friendly but the hotel is in dire need of an update or maybe a fire.  There are many better bu diet hotels for less money in town.,0,negative
"Not the pointe hotel of yester years.   Front desk personnel inept, refers every question to Consigner who is not very competent either.  No signage on building exterior to show elevator, ice machine out of service and no free wifi......really !\nDay 2 no housekeeping at 3pm and ice machine still out of order !\nOnly plus is the bed/pillows are very comfortable and there is a coffee maker in the room.  Still a big disappointment for the $$$$",0,negative

Terrible customer service, the place is totally run down and dirty. \n\nThis hotel just failed at the most basic levels. It is dirty and tired.",0,negative
I HATE this hotel!!! The wait to check in was 20 minutes because the people before us were all complaining. The service just simply sucks. I reserved tickets to a show and they sold my tickets so I had to pay $60 more to purchase them somewhere else.\n\nThe pool was nice but the cocktail servers were useless so I had to go back and forth to the bar.\n\nI will say that the spa was good hence the 1 star above.,0,negative

I would consider giving this place another star or two but first impressions last a lifetime! Upon check in me and my wife dealt with the most rude person I encountered on our vacation.

I stayed in a deluxe room at this place and I can say I will never stay at this hotel again. Just because it's cheap doesn't mean that the quality of the room should be poor.  Tv and the bathroom look so out dated.  Imo this hotel needs a renovation badly.  Only good thing about our room was the view if the strip.  Right in front of Caesars Palace.,0,negative
"I will not come back again. Poor service especially the manager. One of their staff promised me to change to 2 queen bed room on Sat. When I talk to them, they just transfer to manager.

Worst place in the world. Terrible customer service. The front desk ladies are rude and angry. I will NEVER stay here again.

So there I stayed here for 3 days recently.. The rooms were amazing best I have ever been in! The reason it has one star is because I was there with my husband and every time I would walk away from him In the evening for only a second a prostitute would approach him.

This review is for the hotel. The rooms were supposed to be renovated but it's time to renovate again. The rooms are dark and the tub feels like its going to fall through.

This hotel is no help and clueless! I was getting coffee 6 feet away from my table and within seconds someone stolen phone off the table. The staff got very defensive. The front desk was no help.

Although it is close to Carowinds I would never stay here with my children.  If you are thinking about staying here I would reconsider.",0,negative
This place has changed over the years for sure. I stayed for the weekend 7/25/14 and I was not impressed. Customer service was terrible and everything now looks old and cheap.

This place is awful!  They don't care about their guests. We were willing to stay long term but they wouldn't work with us.  You would think they would want the moNey but whatever.  It's a dump.  They never have stuff for breakfast.  The maintenance issues never get fixed n we still have sparkling plugs in our room.  When one starts a fire then they will care.,0,negative
"I have stayed at the Imperial Palace before and have always enjoyed my time there, great location because it's center of the strip.\n\nHowever, I was there recently and had the worst hotel experience, there is no cell service in the hotels, the hallways, rooms and furniture all smells like smoke. Our keys cards continuously stopped working and they only had 2 elevators working! At on e point we waited 30 minutes just for an elevator.",0,negative

Avoid at all cost! Checked in with a GF and they wanted her ID which we provided. Manager Danny rude. Called me on the phone as we went to dinner and threaten me because we supposedly did not provide my GFs ID which we did.   He said its the law. I have traveled the world. There is no such law. I had to call police because manager threatened us! Ghetto shit hole! Now they have charged my credit card for $400 for an $80 room!  Better off sleeping in your car! Dump!,0,negative

"I cannot believe that this hotel is in the ABV network-- it is a true dump. And, when I say dump, I mean literally. It sits next to the City Landfill, and smells just like you would imagine.

At times, we were unsure of whether we had booked at a hotel or at the local homeless shelter. \n\nDo yourself a favor and skip this dump--and ABV hotels altogether.",0,negative

I heard 3 other people complain about headaches. The coaster looks cool from the outside but BEWARE.",0,negative
"This place was pretty bad. The only thing it had going for it was it's location, nothing more! The rooms were in terrible shape, questionable cleanliness, and only one elevator! Wifi wasn't free and parking which was nearly 2 blocks away at Les Suites LaBelle was $15 a night! There was no bellhop so we had to drag our suitcases up a ramp and flight of stairs to the main floor where the front desk and elevator was! It was not worth $149/night!",0,negative
"Booked this hotel as a last resort before reading the reviews on yelp.  All are believable after seeing the place.  My advice, sleep in your rental car.

Outside the paint was peeling everywhere the signs that say \""""not responsible for damaged or stolen cars.\"""" were reassuring.",0,negative
"I admit that this is a nice hotel.  The gardens are impeccable and serene.  But the service is an embarrassment to a hotel of this caliber.

The Ritz Carlton has dated decor, but has much better service.",0,negative
"Don't waste your money here. Especially on a cabana. Once you hit the amount you have to spend ($300 minimum) they kick you out.

Stay Away from this hotel!!!  I promise that you will regret it.

It always take almost 5 mins just to get an elevator.   The carpet in the room was really sticky!!!  It was so gross.   Customer service really sucked.

Stayed here last year and had a very bad time.  The AC wasn't working in the room we were in and I had a hard time with the front desk.  Finally had to move hotels around two in the morning.

"The look and brand of this place is deceptive as the staff's customer service skills are not aligned with any other W or Starwood Hotel I've stayed at.\n\n I'm a frequent business traveler but actually CHOSE to stay here on personal travel recently and was surprised by how terrible the experience was.  Even locals were very vocal about how down-hill this place has gone. \n\nNot at all worth the money and I won't be staying here again. For the same modern feel but a much better vibe, I'll be at the Palomar downtown.",0,negative
This place is a shithole.. I will never go back... service was rude...the rooms are nothing special and try to find your way back to your room at 6:00am.. impossible !!! The layout of the hotel is very confusing and the staff not helpful at all....,0,negative
We had a great stay here while competing at the Nevada Wildfest. The rooms were very clean & comfortable. Had a bit of difficulty at check in because the staff didn't want to accept cash. This hotel allows pets & yet every dog pick up bag holder was empty during our entire stay. The pet area was never cleaned. The hotel's lack of attention to supplies just gives the pet owners another reason not to clean up.,1,positive
This is probably the worst Sheraton property out there. Hotel's just old and rooms aren't very well maintained or cleaned even though maids do a pretty good job everyday.\n\nI've stayed maybe 5 different times on the bottom floors of the hotel and on the top (SPG Platinum) floors and there isn't much difference.\n\nYMMV,0,negative

This is my 2nd stay here and since I had to unload my car at the valet and bring my own 5 suitcases to my room on a valet car I am already disappointed in the service. I actually had to get on the elevator with my own luggage with other people with this big cart. Disappointed that the Fairmont had no vacancies. Ditch this hotel.,0,negative
"Worst hotel ever. Valet is completely rude. I was told to move my car because I was blocking traffic. you have to park in the street to check in. Booked online Hotels.com, got a good deal. Turns out I needed to pay $24.00 for valet, water and other things. \nTo have guest in the room it's $25 a night per person.\nOh and you need a wristband or else you can't go in your room. If you loose the wristband it's $25 to get a new one per night.\nNever again",0,negative
"If you'd like to wait in an hour long line to check in, and another hour long line to check out, this is the hotel for you.

Unfortunately the Rumor boutique hotel did not meet up to my expectations. My expectations for this place were not high for I am familiar with what a boutique hotel is.

I think the hotel has A lot of potential along with many areas to improve on.,0,negative
"although i had a great weekend with my girlfriends, i definitely didn't love this hotel....  severe shortage of chairs around the pool - so annoying.  they clearly want to make $$ on cabanas and day bed rentals.  also, drains around the boulevard pool reeked and didn't like how the pool area was all chopped up into little sections and too much shade everywhere.  everyone's trying so hard to look cool here, that nobody's really having any fun.....  or maybe i just don't have patience for all of that anymore.",0,negative

Rep at the car return couldn't be bothered to hand me my receipt, just tossed it in the trunk and mumbled something as he walked away. \n\nTotally not worth the extra frequent flyer miles you get with Southwest for using Budget.",0,negative

"Use to be the best airline. Now they won't let you use banked monies from family. They are also stupid not letting you fly standby for earlier flight, Thereby freeing up later flights.

"If it was possible to provide negative stars I would.

Our flight ended up being 3+ hours delayed, and there were no apologies from the gate agents, flight attendants, nor pilot.",0,negative
You just don't realize how nice Southwest is until you fly with these bozos. Old MD80s with tiny seats wedged together and bins that hold nothing so you have to check a carryon bag make it miserable. The crews seem jaded because everyone is miserable on the plane and they have just given up. I will do my best to avoid American,0,negative

"I'm rating this airline a four because they are one of the only airlines who still provide free snacks.

Not only did they cancel my flight which I had planned and paid for months in advance, which completely ruined a family get together for me, but to add insult to injury, they did not even refund the $25.00 baggage fee that I did not need because I never flew with this piece of garbage of a company.

I don't know which is more impressive;  The six days I waited to get my lost bag or the more than one week it's been since I complained and am still waiting for a response.  Awful customer service.

US Airways offered $100 credit.  Not enough to entice me to fly them again.  Since I fly them about 30,000 miles a year now, guess they don't mind seeing me go.",0,negative

The planes to hawaii are so old and beaten up, it's embarrassing.  Even most of the employees say that US Airways isn't great.  If US Airways is the cheapest, I would go with them, but if you are paying $10 more for Southwest, take Southwest.",0,negative
Terrible. Dirty airline. Charges ridicules fees for carry-on's.\nThe upgraded service is expensive and not worth the cost.\n\nPlease fly another airline. Jet Blue is a better service.,0,negative
"The absolute worst airline I have ever flown and I flew 90,000 miles this year.  The plane smelled like there was a dead body lost somewhere on it and even after prepaying $50 to check bags my 52 lbs bag ended up costing $150. Could have flown business select on Southwest after all the nickel a dimeing. I will NEVER ever fly this airline again.",0,negative
"We flew from phx to newark and back with a 1 year old. I was so nervous and there was no need to be. Us airways was so accommodating and helpful. Everything was right on schedule all bags, car seat, stroller was right where it needed to be at all times. The flight attendant were so helpful. They even gave us a free seat for our baby! The only thing is the flight food is HORRIBLE. Otherwise I would have given 5 stars.",1,positive
Great airline low prices best part sitting arrangements are very comfortable you pick any available seat you want bags are free,1,positive

"There is nothing fancy about southwest, but there's not much wrong with it either.  On my last flight my only complaint is that the air was not turned on in the plane while we were sitting there waiting for it to take off.  You are able to check two bags and take a carry on.  You get a drink and a snack on your trip although you get the snack before the drink for some reason.  The price is always right.",1,positive
We were very happy to fly with American Airlines. The check in process was very quick and easy. My boyfriend and I had completely desperate seats. At the gate they upgraded our seats for us to sit together without us even asking them to do so. Awesome experience with outstanding customer service!,1,positive
What is one to do when the change/cancel fee is more expensive then what my tickets cost?  I guess US Air will have a few no shows on flights this week.  Thanks for being so accomodating in such extenuating circumstances with Super Storm Sandy!  NOT!,0,negative
Avoid this one. You are not saving any money by using this one as they try to get more for charging not only for luggage but for even for carry on or water!\nThey are not interested in pleasing customers at all. They are only interested in squeezing extra money out of you. They stink!,0,negative
"I hope I never have to fly this airline again, the price may be cheap, but the extras cost us another $200, a rip off, they charge for everything. And there is no leg room at all.",0,negative
This is an awful airline to fly on.  They have no consideration for their clients.  If your 2 min. late for your flight and the plane is still attached to the terminal they won't let you on or will they refund your money.  You are left on your own.  They run out of Captains to fly their plans due to too many hours & your stuck in the airport with no accommodations for food or rest.  Know of several people who have had tickets with them and they are so strict with switching flights etc.  Not an Airline I'd suggest to use.,0,negative
"If I could give 0 stars, I would. Booked via Orbitz, so there was no option to pay for bags, which meant paying $50 for a CARRY-ON. Won't be using them again, ever, and will advise all my industry friends to avoid them, too.",0,negative
"WORST airline. Don't be fooled thinking it is cheap, they charge you extra for EVERYTHING. Your seat, your carry on luggage...yes $40. Their web is horrible, it is constantly down so that you can't check on line or check your bags on line, so you have to do it at the airport for a fee. The fee for your bags double if you do it at the airport.\nI wish I had read all the other reviews before I flew Spirit, NEVER AGAIN!",0,negative

"Ok, so maybe it's because I have a little bit of status with US Airways that I'm biased for and lately, their planes that I have been on have been newer (albeit typically smaller planes than some airlines).  The staff has always been professional and friendly in my dealing with them. So, for me to be a happy camper, I just need newer planes, friendly staff, and good connections. They give me that.",1,positive

I didn't even think to read reviews on this airline and all ready regret it just by doing the online checkin!

Being in the Mandalay Bay hotel/casino, I expected a lot more. We had to wait a while in line but we left with frozen yogurt soft serve in a waffle cone. yum!",0,negative
"$37 for lunch on a weekend. Includes beer, wine and bottomless mimosas. Just tip the bartender/server.\n\nThe food is just okay, but hell, I can drink my money's worth here. Prime rib was decent, crab legs not so much. Most items were just okay. Dessert section wasn't extravagant. \n\nNo line either, so I guess that's a plus or a minus depending on what your perspective is.",1,positive
Enjoyed it even more on our second trip! Think it will be among our go-to bookmarked spots! The two item combo with rice is only $5.99 and is plenty for one... We each get one with different items and share. Love the BBQ pork!!,1,positive
Love the food here and the prices are amazing. Where else can you have two entrees and a huge appetizer and have the bill come out to be 25 bucks?  We even left with left overs for the next day and we are not light eaters. I love the salt and pepper prawn.  It is amazing!!,1,positive
"I was invited because my friend loves the crab legs. The buffet was a little expensive but also paid an additional $10 for unlimited wine and beer. We asked for so much wine, they poured a whole bottle into 2 cups and gave it to us. The buffet itself was great. I explored the entire buffet and it was all really tasty. The dessert is to die for and they even give you cotton candy to take home with you. I recommend.",1,positive
"Another great visit to Humble Pie!\nDid their Thursday Date Night thing.  Two half salads, a pizza & two glasses of wine = $20\nI've always had wonderful food and brilliant service!!!\n\nDon't forget the chili basil sauce :-)",1,positive
"The early bird special is the way to go.. The wife ordered the veggie dinner as well.. Despite earlier post i read it was plenty!! Of food.. The waitress was top notch and the decor is one of the nicest ive observed.. Only reason its not a 5 star is our bill was still 40 for two of us with drinks, even with the early bird.. However, it was flavorful and better than your average hibachi place.",1,positive
Its a bit expensive as they say you should order a meat course and a pasta course.  Went with a big group so I kinda got a taste of a lot of different stuff.  I had a fish in a brown bag that was cooked perfectly and was really flaky.  My pasta course was very good but not earth shattering.  Great place but not sure it was worth the $$$.,1,positive

"Food was way to expensive for us to order. Sat at the bar and had the happy hour drinks.  That was a great price!  The bartenders were very good, happy, and friendly.  Good place as far as I am concerned to get your drink started!",1,positive
"Food was extremely high priced for a place with only 12 tables. Pizza wasn't anything special--kids size was same as mine, but kids pizza is $7 and mine was $16.00...not sure how that makes sense.  My boyfriend ordered the Buon Gusto chicken and it was terrible. We would rather have gone to Grimaldi's, Maggiano's, or Firefly to spend that much money.",0,negative
"$1.00 saki! Warm, strong, and a wonderful compliment to the deliectable array of choices on the ayce menu. The restaurant is intimate, with about 10-15 tables and 6-8 seats at the bar. Very lively chefs who are quick to take your order serve you some fine delicious rolls, soup, nigiri, shumami, and other choices. For $22 a person during dinner for ayce, it's a great bargain for the residents of Northwest Las Vegas.",1,positive
"Still awesome, went last night - 50% off mains with early dining (you have to be out by 7.30 ish, though we stayed till 8 and they didn't notice) is an amazing deal, especially when a full price barbecued marlin steak is only \u00a315 full price...\n\nrecommend fishcakes, and the above steak, which with sweet potato chips is a bit special...Wine's not as cheap as I remember, but I got a good one, so that might be why :S",1,positive
"It's great!  I was never a huge fan of Bobby Flay until I ate here.\n\nI don't think it's overly priced.  It's about $50/person.  I would've loved to try their desserts, but I was too full.  \nI ordered the chicken and it was moist! Couldn't really believe it when I bit into it.  Moist, juicy and the sauce was so yummy!",1,positive
"This is (atleast was until prices skyrocked) a great deal where you can get in your dinner, late night dinner, breakfast, and lunch for the deal of 1 of the buffets. The Spice Market buffet at planet Hollywood is the one i liked the most and there was never any que so you could even walk in just for a drink and icecream!,",1,positive
"Prices weren't too steep for a buffet. Food was actually pretty excellent! The first night I had prime rib, roast beef, shrimp, cheesy garlic potatoes topped with kick ass gravy, corn on the cob, rice pilaf, and some awesome saut\u00e9ed green beans. \n\nDay two was all the same and then some. I had some great tasting roasted duck, barbecued pork buns, garlic basil shrimp, and I finished off the day with a couple of sorbettos. MMMMMmm good!\n\nI might also add that the hotel was actually great. HUGE room for so cheap.",1,positive
Great food.  This meal will be an investment.  I would guess around $80 per person.  Make sure you are interested in eating Traditional- American Chinese food.  This is a dressy restaurant with one of the best views of the fountain in the city.,1,positive
"Tasting menu at $22 per person was absolutely fantastic! Let the chef take control, it's the way to go. Fresh ingredients, well-presented, and the staff were super friendly and efficient. As mentioned in other reviews we loved the music, as well. The perfect summer treat in a really cool neighborhood. Can't praise this place enough!",1,positive
"$4 steak and eggs with players club card? I'm in!\n\nNaturally, I got the steak and eggs (sunny side up). Obviously, the steak isn't going to taste like a $15 steak but for $4, it was amazing. Topped with either sourdough or white bread, which they pre-butter, and smeared with jam? You won't be able to get enough. Possibly the  most filling $4 meal I've ever had.\n\nBonus: You can make back your meal by betting $5 on black or red. Whichever floats your boat.",1,positive
Can't beat their chef special. Two entree for $40 & you each take a dish of your choice home.,1,positive
"Bleh it was free with room and I also got comped so got to enjoy 3 buffets each(lucky me ugh)  They serve the same food for lunch and dinner daily for $20 each I would have been really mad if I had to pay for it. There were a couple of good things mashed potatoes and gravy was yummy, chinese noodles and a good salad choice.",0,negative
There is one in July every year and one in the winter but Im not sure when.  The website lists participating restaurants and you can book right from there on open table.  They all provide a 3 course meal for $30.  This year we did Aria and The Peculiar Rabbit and both were awesome.  Such a fun way to try new restaurants.,1,positive
"My little one and I were excited to get some Sweet Tomatoes. We were craving the soups, salads, and other goodies. Being a budget minded mother, Sweet Tomatoes is pocket friendly and reasonably healthy. It's also laid back. \n\nAfter today, I'm sad to say I won't be visiting the Tempe Sweet tomatoes anymore because if I wanted to spend $10.00+++ on a bowl of soup and some dingy salad I'll go somewhere else. \n\nWhat made Sweet Tomatoes a success was that it was a buffet. I honestly foresee this as a flop.",0,negative
"What a deal! $8.99 for steak (medium rare - was juicy!), green beans and your choice of mashed potatoes, fries or baked potatoes! This is not on the menu but you need to print the meal promotion from your rewards account for the casino.\nNot exactly your 5 stars establishment but the food will definitely bring me back for my next visit to Vegas!",1,positive
"I decided to invite business partners to Restaurants for Restaurant week as a good excude to get together, enjoy good food and donate to a GREAT cause.  I was pleasantly surprised at the Cubano Panino on the menu for Restaurant Week.  A three course meal for $20.11.  NICE!",1,positive
"Had a great steak lunch here. Top Sirloin with French fries and green beans.\n\nFor $8.99 you can't beat that.\n\nThere is a wait,so make sure you place your name with the host first and then kill time at the slots.",1,positive
"Who knew this little place was going to be this good? The food, quite inexpensive, is VERY good. I had some crab cakes that were as good as any I've had, even when in Baltimore or Boston. The fish tacos were to die for. We left feeling quite full, and the bill was less than $25 for all of us.",1,positive
"The muddled drinks are to die for, as are the starters. Three of us were full after splitting the mac & cheese, nachos and ribs. If you're really hungry, have some sort of starter, soup or salad because the dinky entrees will not fill you up. Scallops (3), fried chicken (3 pc drumsticks the size you get when you order wings)...and 2x the price of the starters. Our server was adorable and on top of things - I wish I'd caught his name so I could give him props!",1,positive
"Pricey!!!  However, great meal as usual. When visiting Scottsdale, we always go their once for dinner. It's our date night when we leave the kids with the parents.\nKing crab legs were the best that I've ever had. The butter cake was delicious.",1,positive
"It is pricey but worth the money! I went with the 4 course meal and I left super satisfied. A note to any jews or muslims, they cook with wine so it may not be an option for yous.",1,positive
"Went during Sunday brunch (3/30/14) the price was reasonable at 29.99 per person although alcohol was not included, had a lot of choices including crab legs, oysters & Mediterranean food on top of the typical buffet food. Our waitress was super friendly, but the cashiers need to adjust ther attitudes. Overall food was good, just stay away from the sushi.",1,positive

"The ambiance is fantastic! Situated inside the Waldorf Astoria's Biltmore Resort, the location is perfect. There is a cold buffet that has delicious, fresh shrimp and other delicious cold seafood. Nice selection of cheese and deli meats along with a great spread of fresh bread such as buttery croissants. The freshly prepared hot items were fantastic! Our favorites were the grilled shrimp on polenta and the pancakes with warm maple syrup and a great blueberry compote. At $40/person, a very nice value.",1,positive
Too pricey for the food. The meal I had was just ok. My MIL had a terrible loud garlic pasta. It was stinky. They were also not too happy to see my two kids in tow.,0,negative
Worth every penny of the $86 tab for two people. The flavors POPPED in every dish.\nVery nice selection and the staff was a great help constantly coming around asking if you want drinks and clearing your table.\nI know it's simple but the chicken noodle soup is a must try.,1,positive
"We bought a travelzoo voucher for this place. The food was okay, nothing special. I probably wouldn't pay full price. Service was fine. Dessert was probably the best",0,negative
"Black & Blue, Guiness and Blue Moon- $11, over priced, food was good, french dip, service was great, we had Teresa, she did a great job and we would come back again, no problem",1,positive
"The food was okay, nothing special at all. It's around $18-$25 per plate. The goblets of drinks were the cool part though they were $36 which is really pricey. The white gummy one was really tasty but not enough alcohol in my opinion...\n\nI would definitely not come again.",0,negative
Lunch (soup and a salad) for under $15.  The service was very good and the food was excellent.  We will be back,1,positive
I think the all you can eat is too expensive for what they offer. I've had better and less expensive in Korea Town in LA,0,negative
"Definitely not worth the $35. It's decent as far as buffets go, hence two stars instead of one, but there are so many other places to eat where you won't get ripped off and have decent food.",0,negative
"Breakfast for my wife and was $100 including tip.    I've never had a 2 person $100 breakfast before.    Clearly I've been missing out.   Wow, Damn, Holy Hell, this is really good food.    It's the Wynn so expect it to be perfectly executed and you won't be disappointed.    \n\nFor many years now, the wife and I always do breakfast at the Bellagio, NO MORE.   The Wynn wins.    Do yourself a favor and try it.",1,positive
Didn't actually eat here. Waited 15 minutes and still no wait staff came so we bailed and had an awesome meal down the hall at the buffet for probably even cheaper! (Breakfast at the buffet is less than $10!),0,negative
My wife and I always get the 4 course dinner for two!\n\nEgg Drop Soup? Love it!\nCrab Won Tons? Love it!\nKung Pao Shrimp? LOVE IT!\nImproved the desserts to larger size!\n\nIn West Valley this location is easier to get a table than Peoria.,1,positive
"We actually had a coupon for 25 dollars off.... we had 2 bottles of wine, crab cakes and two entrees... with the coupon it was around 100 bucks (including tip)  Very good food.

"This spot is a great atmosphere with inspired creations that will tickle your taste buds. Portion sizes are a little small for the big eater, but everything we tried was delicious. Highly recommend the shishito peppers as well as the shrimp and lobster dish. Service was outstanding. Be prepared to spend $100 per person for a full meal and drinks. Great dining experience !",1,positive
"Took my father here for his birthday and to participate in restaurant week. Six dollars of each meal was donated to Three Square. The three course meal was delicious, pops was quite please with his meal, and they even remembered it was his birthday from making the reservation and put a candle in his dessert. Awesome food and ambiance. I'm a fan.",1,positive
"for ~48 bucks, I ate at the caesar, planet hollywood, and the rio.  The rio was the best of the three followed by planet hollywood.  Highly suggest getting the buffet of buffets b/c it lasts 24 hours and its cheap",1,positive
"Bought a Google Offer this past weekend, $20 for $40 worth of food.  Stopped to pick up lunch for me and a friend and wow, $40 went far!  And it was GOOD!!!  \nWe had sushi, rolls, tempura veggies, and the monkey brains.  Way too much food for two of us and it was all out of this world.  \n\nI'm a huge sushi fan and the fish was sliced perfectly and so so fresh- like butter!  The rolls were great too, not too much rice and a perfect bite size.  \n\nWe will definitely be back!",1,positive
"Excellent food, reasonable prices, and solid service.  The cost of the buffet/ unlimited around is $12.50 and includes drinks.  The food was all pretty fresh and the wait was minimal.\n\nI will definitely return for some more Mongolian BBQ!",1,positive
Amazing deal for 39.99 per person inc. drinks for an unlimited buffet. 12 different cuisines plus over 3 dozen desserts. Rated 8.5 out of 10 for our party of 4. This is not your parents buffet. This is awesome!,1,positive
We visited on a Friday night and got a window table in the Swan Court. It was fun to feed bread to the swans. The only negative was a prix fixe menu with a minimum cost per meal of $85. The creme brulle dessert was the best I've ever had!,1,positive

We eat here about once a month and always order from the Happy Hour menu which has great prices on food and drinks. We can get a family of 4 fed on less than $40 (tip included) and everyone leaves full. Good Rolls and appetizers and definitely the best sushi we have found in the area.,1,positive
"This place is pricey! My best friend and I came here to slurp so we did. Both of us over $250. The food was very pretty and tasty. The ambiance was fancy...very fancy, so if you come, please dress up. But what really got me to give it 4 stars was the amazing customer service. \n\n*They have a variety of selection for the wine, if you are a wine lover. Also the mini breads that they give out while waiting for the food are absolutely adorable.",1,positive

"Alex is so expensive! I ate with my uncle and there was like 8 of us for $2000! It was really good though, except for the goose liver. EWww! I know I'll probably never eat there again though. Super classy, romantic type environment. Hahaha. The portions are really small, but in a good way because you get to try a lot of different things. Flavor's pretty strong too so it gets overwhelming if one dish was the whole meal.",1,positive
"Had the $10 okonomiyaki on a Saturday morning. Hostess was friendly and attentive. Was seated promptly. Okonomiyaki was flavorful with cabbage, pork, shrimp, and bonito flakes. Portion was adequate but probably not justifiable by its price. I would check out their drinks and other items if I had more money... Anyhow, beautiful ambience and use of Teeter's House space. This would be an excellent date or impress your out-of-town-friends spot.",1,positive

"What brought us here tonight was a one-time collaboration with chef Nick Hodge from Icehouse.  The $75 \""""Kyoto vs Austin\"""" menu listed seven courses, with each chef alternating a course.

"Food was extremely high priced for a place with only 12 tables. Pizza wasn't anything special--kids size was same as mine, but kids pizza is $7 and mine was $16.00...not sure how that makes sense.

Great service, very accomodating, and overall really fun and tasty experience.",1,positive
33 dollar breakfast buffet is awesome. New breakfast spot.,1,positive
So start off the grounds weren't kept up very well and it it's in downtown Phoenix.  this place wants a $1500 outside catering fee or or you can pay $26 per plate for any type of food which means that they arent good at making any specific type of food.  Charges for September and December are cheaper but are more expensive than the nice places in Scottsdale.  If you're looking for a wedding or just a reception or any event for that matter don't go here.,0,negative
"Blueberry pancakes, eggs, bacon & fruit - all for around $7 - winner winner. Shared with my daughter. The food was great, Eggs cooked perfectly.

"$10 lunch menu is totally worth it. Servers attentive and helped us get in & out in the short time that we required to get back to convention center. My chicken salad was very tasty, and my dining partner loved his fish tacos.",1,positive
"Very pricy for what you get, the food was good, although the restaurant around the corner from my house is as good if not better.  We sat at our table for 30 mins before our order was taken.  When we did get our food they forgot a few of the entrees.  Overall the service was sub par at best, ehich for the price I would expect an overall much better experience.",0,negative
"They can be pricey for a Larger Family, however they are really good. They are casual and dressy. There beer is GREAT!",1,positive
"I had their buffet brunch (weekday) which was very reasonably priced - I think it was $23?

"This was my first dining experience at Green Valley, but I was not disappointed. Some of us had delicious fresh fish grilled with saut\u00e9ed veggies, others had delicious oysters, while I had the all you can eat crab legs.

We went to Sunday Mother's Day brunch. It was 50 dollars plus. I ordered a mimosa assuming it was included like most Sunday brunches but it was extra. I wanted fresh berries but they didn't have any of those either. Great atmosphere but a real rip off on the food side . Really limited selection . A true tourist trap .,0,negative
"If this were rated on prices, this would be a 2 star. \n\nI love the calamari. It costs like $11. Its way more than i'm willing to pay for that stuff, but do everytime. \n\nSo the story goes: they have hundreds of thousands of beers on tap....yadda yadda yadda...",1,positive
"Skip Sunday brunch and come for Saturday breakfast.  Best deal in town from 7:30-10:30 am. Lunch is also super affordable at $13.95.  If you look at where I've eaten in my Yelp career, I'm not normally value driven, but that said, I appreciate getting what I pay for, or in this case getting way more.  I think for the holidays they're doing lobster Thursdays for dinner. It might be worth checking out.",1,positive
"$50 a person for this?? Plus 18% gratuity for parties over 8. We saw our \""""server\"""" twice. We had to chase people down to get our drinks. The food was mediocre at best, I've had better microwave tv dinners.The only thing I enjoyed was the coffee at the end. \n\nIf you're looking for a disappointing meal, try McDonald's instead; at least you're only paying $6 for a bad meal instead of $50.",0,negative
As the famous Biltmore brunch was not available (remodeling the dining room) this was our next runner up - at $20 the breakfast buffet was a steal for such high quality ingredients. The Bloody Mary was no slouch at $9 either.,1,positive
"This is my buffet dream come true! It has every selection of food you could possibly want to eat. They had Italian, Asian, American, Korean, Japanese, Chinese food, and tons of cute little desserts. It was about $50/pp with unlimited mimosas and $40/pp without mimosa. The food lives up to the expectation of the cost. We spent a good 2 hrs here enjoying the food. The line is long, but it gets even longer after 10am. I highly recommend this place and to go early.",1,positive
"I went there during the opening weekend. The place looks so cute! The desserts tasted delicious and well presented. The edible menu was a nice surprise. Pretty expensive, but what a cool concept. You should definitely try it once though. There's a minimum charge per person; if I remember correctly, it's $12 per person, drinks not included.",1,positive
"I was invited because my friend loves the crab legs. The buffet was a little expensive but also paid an additional $10 for unlimited wine and beer. We asked for so much wine, they poured a whole bottle into 2 cups and gave it to us. The buffet itself was great. I explored the entire buffet and it was all really tasty. The dessert is to die for and they even give you cotton candy to take home with you. I recommend.",1,positive
"Shrimp fettuccine & lasagne are incredible! Our waiter was very helpful & even told us about a Lychee drink they used to make,  and they were able to make it for us even though it was no longer on the menu! Yummm... I frequently stay at MGM signature & will definitely go back to this restaurant. No too pricey considering it's a Wokfgang Puck restaurant.",1,positive
"This place is huge! They have a nice selection of frozen food, fresh food, and dried food.\n\nStayed in vegas for the weekend, and our suite had a kitchen. What better way than to stock the kitchen with food for $1.\n\nMany of the foods you can find here are found in normal stores for $2 or $3 more. What a steal!",1,positive
"$47 dollars for 2 people, you would think the food is good. This crap was nasty. The only foods that were decent was the little fried shrimp and the ice cream. What a waste of money and time. Never again and why was it so much dessert, but hardly anything else?",0,negative
"Excellent food, reasonable prices, and solid service.  The cost of the buffet/ unlimited around is $12.50 and includes drinks.  The food was all pretty fresh and the wait was minimal.\n\nI will definitely return for some more Mongolian BBQ!",1,positive
"The restaurant is a relaxing space. And, I appreciate the 10 under $10 lunch idea. It would be useful, however, for the wine list to be clear that the 8 oz. glasses of house wines run $12. I had two glasses, my friend one, and just like that we had a $36 liquor bill. I had an ahi tuna skewer. It was ok - not much flavor. The stir fried vegetables were very salty. My friend order salmon cakes but a different salmon dish arrived. Overall, my feeling is that I could have spent $65.00 elsewhere for a far nicer experience.",0,negative
"Delicious meal! I understand the the higher prices come at the cost of eating predominantly local fresh ingredients. I am 100%ok with this! We ordered the bacon onion tart with delicious tomatoes baked on top. Amazing. Our meals were delicious, both the pork loin and catfish were tasty. Beautiful set up, not too crowded and loved the booths. Can't wait for the full patio to open up. Great job, we will be back!",1,positive
"We found this restaurant on YELP and went there exactly at 5.  Already there were 7 other people waiting.  We were seated quickly and our server got our drinks in quick time. My Bloody Mary was great.  My one son ordered off the Shushi menu and other and I off the regular.  The meals are about $30 but well worth it in my opinion.  Soup, salid and a good selection of sauces, some made on the spot.   Modest, older restaurant with excellent food",1,positive
"I wonder how much it would cost to get these guys as a personal chef?\n\nDined at Salt of the Earth on Saturday evening without reservations and we waited for 2 drinks (maybe 45 minutes? 60? ehhh who knows). Communal seating makes finding out what is good for the evening that much easier since the menu changes daily.\n\nTIP: If you see something on the board you wan (food or drink), order it! Quantities are limited! We saw our entree get erased immediately after ordering ;-)\n\nmmmm When can I go back?",1,positive
33 dollar breakfast buffet is awesome. New breakfast spot.,1,positive
"Expensive, but great food.  I got lucky with dinner for two and a bottle of wine through Groupon, but what they didn't say was it was about $20 towards a bottle of wine, and only 3 were close to that price.  Food was excellent for the Groupon price, and service was great!",1,positive
"$26.75 will get you :\nRefrigerator flavored bread and butter\nStale chips and runny old salsa\nBrown over cooked meat (or is it?)\nSushi (wait, what is that again? Rice and cucumbers, oh yeah, sushi)\nShrimp cocktail from costco\nFrozen Crab legs\nBurnt potato wedges\nA sign that says bread pudding, but I wouldn't dare try it to find out if the sign were true. A reminder of why I haven't done a buffet in 20 years and why I will never again. Blech. \nNice server though.",0,negative
"This was a really nice outing with the friends. Price of $10.5 for 2.5 hours of bowling seemed reasonable. Also, the pizza was unexpectedly nice and beer was good. I'd highly recommend it.",1,positive
"Wow! I had a taste for Indian and just happened to stumble upon the lunch buffet. For $9, I had an unbelievabe lunch. A decent, but not exhausted selection of popular Indian dishes. What amazed me is that every one I sampled was excellent. And then they brought out bread, as if the buffet wasn't enough. I'll be back-often.",1,positive
"All you can eat for less than $30. Good food and free champagne before 3pm on weekends if you want.\n\nEverything from sushi, pasta, to steaks.\n\nGood service too.",1,positive
"Expensive, but worth every cent. Get the tasting menu, you won't regret it. Also, belly up to the bar and interact with the staff...they are knowledgeable, friendly and seem to actually like their jobs. Also, sitting at the bar you get to see all the action. It is so impressive to watch the kitchen in action - it is like a an orchestra for food. And the food....I don't even have enough of a vocabulary to describe it. Just. Eat. Here.",1,positive
"Wife and I had an overpriced breakfast at Market Cafe Vdara. \n\nFresh Squeezed OJ didn't taste fresh, and both the eggs Benedict and the scrambled eggs were just blah. \n\nCost $55 for the two of us, luckily we had a resort credit, that is the only way i would recommend the Cafe.",0,negative
Go to Wicked Spoon!  Your wallet and palate will thank you for it.  $47 for very mediocre food.  Kids over 8 were the same price and it was brunch.  Nothing was spectacular.  The ingredients were average and didn't seem very fresh.\n\nTheir website gave us the bait and switch.  It said $41.99 for weekend brunch and champagne was included.  They charged us $47 and champagne was an extra $10.   I can't believe people wait in long lines for this crap!,0,negative
"May be Good for Dine in, but don't bother on take out!! 2 entree's with NO extras was $24 and the main dishes were DRY and not spicy (one was supposed to be a SPICY dish). So I will go down the street a bit and get a Better, Cheaper Meal next time for take out!!!!!!!!!!!!!",0,negative

We visited on a Friday night and got a window table in the Swan Court. It was fun to feed bread to the swans. The only negative was a prix fixe menu with a minimum cost per meal of $85. The creme brulle dessert was the best I've ever had!,1,positive
"$10 lunch menu is totally worth it. Servers attentive and helped us get in & out in the short time that we required to get back to convention center. My chicken salad was very tasty, and my dining partner loved his fish tacos.",1,positive

"Such a waste of money! I was very disappointed when I came here for my friend's birthday dinner. It is $27.00 per person for food that is not that good. I usually enjoy Asian buffets, but I was not thrilled with this one. I will not be back.",0,negative

"Huge portions!\nAll you can eat sushi dinner is 29 bucks, which includes every roll even specialty rolls which is cool according to the friend that got it.\nI went with a tempura and beef rib dinner which was boring.\nI've had better, but could possibly return just because this is so close to my house, maybe the lunch specials are ok?",0,negative
"This is very good food and the Filet to die for ... But you probably will, when you pay your ticket. Ate there with the wife, and for two people al-a-carte, it ran us about or close too, $200 bucks. It was really good,like bomb. But so was the price of dinner. I could of bought a week's worth of groceries for the two of us. But it was time for a treat. So, I treated her or us. The service was great along with the food.The atmosphere was nice and cozy as well. Enjoyed our time and the good eats. Thx",1,positive

Service is decent, but a bit rushed..",1,positive

"Went to the brunch buffet last saturday.  No line, which was great, but that was the best part of our experience.  The brunch is now $23, no more local discount available, so $73 for our group of three for an average breakfast.  For this price I would expect more variety and higher end foods, like shrimp.  Champagne was included, but now the waiters pour instead of the bar they had, not a good restriction.  Taking this brunch off of my places to go list.",0,negative
"Kinda expensive, but was seriously the best service I have ever had at a restaurant! All the staff was great and our waiter, Toad, was exceptional! Burger, wings, and mac & cheese were all great.",1,positive
"The Margarita Brunch on Sunday is definitely a great value.  $16.99 gets you delicious buffet offerings, omelet station, beautiful desserts and house margaritas free flowing.  This was my birthday choice and nothing, I mean nothing, says happy birthday like margaritas for breakfast!",1,positive
"Had the omakasa style with friends and it came out to be about $250/person Doh!! (we did drink a lot of Saki from the bamboo decanter though...)  Great meal, super fun and tasty.  The highlight was the yellowtail with jalapeno on ponzu and the black miso on lettuce wrap.  Very great restaurant and amazing service.",1,positive
A bit pricey for what you get. Overall a great time with good food. Split the combo for more options and enjoyed it.,1,positive
"The meet was super good, the buffet was limited. The service was amazing\nWould I come here for 60$? No. But I had a restaurant.com gift certificate so I tried it. The let is request additional meat, ask for extras of our favorite, and kept up a lot on our drinks. Based on service it's a five, food a four (because of the limited buffet) and price i would make a three.",1,positive
"What a treat. The more I go to strip mall restaurants with cultural cooking, the more chains are obsolete. Pio pio master's the art of chicken rotisserie. Pair a whole chicken with green and ripe plantains, rice and beans, and mixed veggies and you have a filling dinner with enough leftover for lunch the next day--less than $30 can feed two people. Be warned, the sangria is smooth and seductive and a pitcher worth will double your bill. Yum!",1,positive
"It was late at night in Vegas and we decided to have some Korean food instead.  The food is okay, but it was a little overpriced according to their portion.  Be prepared to pay 15% gratuity if you have 4 or more people.  \""""All you can eat BBQ\"""" was not bad for just $20, but have to finish it in an hour.",0,negative
"Good food, very cool interior and great coctails. Very modern and professional atmosphere for meetings, lunch or dinner.  Careful... lunch for 2 with an appetizer, main course, a couple of soft drinks and gratuity will run around $50-$60.  The rooftop patio is the coolest in Phoenix with daytime views of Piestawa Peak and the Biltmore Shopping Center and nighttime views of the hustle and bustle of Camelback Road and the Biltmore Shopping Center.",1,positive
"It's not what I remembered it to be, $45/person? And we were still hungry at the end? And we didn't even get much alcohol? We paid 50 bucks for kalbi? That wasn't even all that great to begin with? WOW! \n\nStill the restaurant of choice when my and the girlfriend comes.",0,negative
"We got free dinner and a show from hotel. They have a separate menu for these 'free' meals. They did offer to give credit toward full price item on regular menu. \n\nFood was good. The'spicy' tilapia that I had was not spicy, but I think the blackening is probably enough that some people may find it spicy. \n\nWe would not have gone there on our own. The free meal was good to get us to look at menu and choose it. Drinks tip and tax are not included.",1,positive
"Black & Blue, Guiness and Blue Moon- $11, over priced, food was good, french dip, service was great, we had Teresa, she did a great job and we would come back again, no problem",1,positive
"Made a 6:30pm Rez and were taken right to our table.  We chose the balcony seating.  Nice view of the strip and the treasure island pirate show.  I ordered the ceaser salad ($17!) and the husband got the pasta carbonana, very good and enough for us to share.  We ordered and the food came out in literally less than 5 mins.  Good food and reasonable price!",1,positive
Are you lost? Run away from this place as fast as you can! Not only the vodka will ruin your stomach but also the horrible thing they call food. At $35 ($45 with taxes and tips) the holidays menu is a total rip-off.,0,negative
"What a great little find thanks to Yelp!  There were 3 of us and we had a family sized dinner salad for a little over $10 with an excellent pomegranate dressing. Then we had a large pizza - The Spicy Italian, which was awesome!  The meat was very good and the crust was excellent on the thin crust.  We will definitely be back!  Out waitress was super nice too.",1,positive
"Great service: When my wife and I went, there were only 2 servers, 1 host, 1 bartender, and 2 cooks, yet all table were attended well (from what I could see) and the servers were working together as a team- Good Stuff! \n\nReasonable prices: 3 entrees, an appetizer and 3 alcoholic drinks for under $80. \n\nTry the pulled pork sandwich! It's sweet, savory, creamy, soft, crunchy; a very complete sandwich.",1,positive
"Breakfast for my wife and was $100 including tip.    I've never had a 2 person $100 breakfast before.    Clearly I've been missing out.   Wow, Damn, Holy Hell, this is really good food.    It's the Wynn so expect it to be perfectly executed and you won't be disappointed.    \n\nFor many years now, the wife and I always do breakfast at the Bellagio, NO MORE.   The Wynn wins.    Do yourself a favor and try it.",1,positive

"My boyfriend and I bought the groupon which included 2 speciality alcoholic drinks, 2 meat and fish, and a dessert. The meat was fabulous, especially the sausages and their special meat. I wasn't crazy about the fish - mainly because the meats were so flavorful. They have a large sides bar. They also give you homemade chips and sauce. It's a great deal as you get a lot of good. Even better of a deal if you get the groupon. I would recommend going if you like meat.",1,positive
"The prices are very expensive for the food you receive.  The Duck was three  little dollops (like chicken satay) on  a tiny dish with three grapes and that was an entree.\n\nFor appetizers we chose ribs, beets and eggplant....The ribs were tasty and tough, the beets were cut so think they were a joke and the eggplant was a mouthful . Oh, the french fries for $5.00 was the best bet.\n\nDinner was $90.00 with tip and we left hungry - yes we had two $5.00 glasses of wine.",0,negative
"we stopped here for lunch and got a very nice strip side table for two, we ordered the seafood tower for two for $49, in my opinion this was an amazing value, we had a wole lobster, 4 fresh oysters, four large prawns, salmon tartare which was absolutely delicious, crackers and dips served on a bed of ice with lemon wedges. Such a great meal on a hot day.",1,positive
"Got a discount for the buffet from purchasing firstly at the tix4tonight stands. Instead of paying $25, we paid $11.99 and it includes unlimited wine and beer. Food was pretty good but they are doing some construction, so the salad and dessert bar where smashed against eachother. But overall, worth it.",0,negative
"I just had my first visit hear with a party of about 25 to celebrate a birthday.

"I loved this place. My husband and I shared the porterhouse which was perfectly prepared medium rare and split for us at no charge. We also splurged on the lobster mashed potatoes which, at $34, seemed over the top...and they were! We only wish the bread hadn't been so good so we could have eaten all of our meal and maybe shared a desert. Oh well, we will just have to go back.",1,positive
"Hey, you can't go wrong with the brunch.  For around $12, you get a pretty tasty meal and a drink included.  It's a great deal compared to their regular-menu entrees, which were running around $16-$18, not including a drink.  I had the benedict that was on the brunch menu, and, in all honesty, the eggs were very overcooked (i.e. not runny at all, but a hard cooked yolk), but I still enjoyed the sauce and the potatoes that came with it.  And the margarita at 11:00 in the morning ain't half bad, either.",1,positive
"This was my first dining experience at Green Valley, but I was not disappointed. Some of us had delicious fresh fish grilled with saut\u00e9ed veggies, others had delicious oysters, while I had the all you can eat crab legs. After four buckets of legs & claws, I was overwhelmingly satisfied, and when we received the bill it averaged to less that $30 a person with food and wine.\nI would return here anytime!",1,positive
"They were out of Chilean Sea Bass, so we had to order the steamed Rock Fish.  This entre alone was $120.00.  It only barely fed one person.  All skull and bones.  Do not order this, it is a total major rip off.  Felt for my brother since he recommended this restaurant and I was afraid to askhim  what the total bill was.  I'm guessing $300 for three people. The rest of the meal was minimal and left us hungry.  Had to go to place in the food court nearby later for a snack.",0,negative
"My wife and I went to Cravings while in town for our anniversary. We showed up around 4:30, and were charged the lower \""""early bird\"""" rate. There was plenty to choose from. The star of the show was the Prime Rib.  The prime rib was very tender and moist, as was the carved roast turkey.  I had to grab seconds on the prime rib.  Decent ribs, bbq chicken, sushi.  I skipped the pizza. You can get pizza anywhere right? I ended up eating three plates, and managing to find a little room for dessert.",1,positive
"OMG, FOOD POISONING!!!!!!!!!!\n\n\nAte here a week ago and I paid for it in the worse possible way. Everything was mislabeled and the waitress taking our drink orders was incredibly bitter.

I came on a Tuesday evening and since I am over 50 (barely) dinner was 1/2 off. Amazing. The waitress recommended a Chimichanga with shredded beef.  Loved it. And the white death margarita was great and it was pretty big. Good stop. I recommend this place if you are looking for a friendly family Mexican restaurant.  Bill came to $15.  What a deal!,1,positive
"Met friends here last night for restaurant week. The food was fantastic and the variety offered was a great value. They even included wine or sake. The lobster rolls were very good.\nThe only negative I found was the waiter had no idea what was on the restaurant week menu or how the whole deal worked. Once he figured it out, he did a nice job.\nAmazing amount of food and drink for $30.",1,positive
Great view overlooking the strip way overpriced got two non alcoholic drinks a shrimp cocktail and a side Caesar salad and the bill was $37,0,negative

Stuff yourself, and then have a super light dinner to fit into that tiny black dress ;)\n\nNoteworthy items: creme brulee, panang curry, oxtail soup, the gelato, berry burst cider (wine and beer is included in the buffet price!), and their custom lattes with Bailey's, Amaretto, or Kahlua added.\n\nI'm a fan.",1,positive

"As far as the $7.77 steak and shrimp dinner goes... I recommend getting it medium-well done. I get crap for ordering well done steaks, but the chef's at Mr. Lucky's know how to keep it moist and yummy.  While I was enjoying my cooked steak, everyone else was chewing on some bloody meat. hahah Also, I do not recommend the mashed potatoes!\n\nOther than what I've just said, this place is pretty standard.

"Pricey at $45 each (plus tip for someone bringing drinks)and alcohol costs extra, for dinner.  But that's average compared to every other place around. Excellent food & selection. Prime rib, crab legs & dry rub ribeye were worth the price alone. The desserts are wonderful - we tried 10 or more &they were all yummy!  Mac & cheese & truffle scalloped potatoes were amazing too.",1,positive
Just had a great evening and topped things off at the Aria buffet. $86.46 for two at dinner time. The food was excellent .

The selection was pretty good, solid and well planned out.  The Prime Rib was VERY good as was the Chicken Marsala, though it could have been warmer.  My husband loved the sushi.  Big fan of the carrot cake, as it was moist and fresh and very well made. Over all, a solid 3.5 stars.",1,positive
"We booked this place without knowing about their \""""2 Courses for \u00a310\"""" offer, so that was a welcome surprise.

"Was really excited to eat here after reading the menu but the comfort food didn't materialize. Had the meatloaf and it was unfortunately dry.

"It's a little pricey, but it's in a casino.  What can you do.\n\nTheir menu is HUGE!  I mean, you can get just about anything your heart desires.

That's quite the stretch on food selection, if you ask me.\n\nWe were both happy and satisfied, even if his giant hot dog cost $16.",1,positive
"We went there for brunch for $37 a person with tax it goes to $40 dollars even.  I have to admit the service was great as the people gave us our drinks and then cleaned our table as soon as we got more food.  They service bone marrow, kalbi beef, chicken sausage and all the trimmings. It was very good, they do have an omelet station, wished i tried it, but was too lazy to wait.  Pretty big, the quality of food was great and dessert was good.  Great buffet, not so sure for $40 a head, but lot of variety which is nice.",1,positive

Ok. I didn't go for a meal just the happy hour. Went for the chips and salsas$2.95. Great deal. Also had two margaritas. Well made at only $5 each. You can sit in front and people watch. Fun,1,positive

"Came here on a Friday night. Place was crowded and lively, but we didn't have to wait longer than 15 minutes. \n\n2 lbs of shrimp\n2lbs of crawfish\nSweet potato fries\n2 sides of rice and corn on the cob\n4 beers\n\nTotal came to less than $80 bucks for 4 people. Not bad! \nKey is to get the rice to catch that yummy, buttery, garlicky sauce!\n\nWould definitely come back next time I'm in town...just not on a first date. ;)",1,positive
"DeeeLISH! \n\nThe meal price includes a large custom salad appetizer, all your side dishes and  a significant dessert - I hate it when steakhouses make you pay for everything separate!! (Ruth Chris??!! Sheesh)\n\nMy steak melted in my mouth, it was AMAZING, best I've ever had in Vegas. The service was also stellar. \n\nEven though it's in a trashy hotel, it's nothing but class all the way at Hugo's ...",1,positive
"Their lounge offers their own menu, with some a la carte items and a $29 3-course prix fixe menu.  The gracious staff had no problem splitting 2 of the prix fixe meals between the 4 of us.  We didn't go hungry, either.  We ate like kings, having a beautiful green salad, what is touted as the best burger in Vegas (and it is even better than Burger Bar) and some amazing butterscotch pudding.  Beautiful room, outstanding service and outstanding food.",1,positive
"I thoroughly enjoyed dinner here.  The filet was delicious, it was served on a iron skillet which kept it warm.  Eat it fast as it practically melts when you first get it.\n\nThey have a huge wine selection, it was like looking through a telephone book.\n\nI thought the crabcakes were terrific, I definitely recommend those.\n\nIts obviously not going to be a cheap meal but I think its reasonable for the service and food.  Sometimes you just have to live a little even in this economy.",1,positive
"Be aware of the following!!!!!!\nIf you try to use restaurant .com or groupon....the restaurant doesn't count alcohol in the total bill!!!\nI spent $103 and they refused to allow restaurant .com\n\nSecond,....if you request a song from the band??? Cost you $20 bucks!!!\nEven Happy Birthday.I tipped $5 and a band member said all requests are $20.\n\nWe will not return.",0,negative
"Be prepared to spend a little more for a huge portion. I definitely recommend sharing a plate instead of ordering your own.  Food was mediocre and overpriced for the lack of quality. I am not too crazy about some bugs flying around our food, very irritating. Service was awesome though. They know how to hire servers with personality. If you are looking for a social place to grab run of the mill American brunch food then come here. If you are a foodie like me go elsewhere.",0,negative
Worth every penny. Be careful not to eat too much! Seafood is A+! Seriously good\n\nWow. Worth every penny; even sitting at the bar.,1,positive
"Restaurant in Aria Hotel that's open 24/7. Needed food badly after an allnighter. Since my hotel, Vdara has no food options at this hour, I walked to Aria and found this place. Nice decor, but the food wasn't that great. I ordered an omelette. Nothing special. Like denny's except twice the price.\n\n$25 including tip.",0,negative
"Went there with my family for lunch, and the price fix menu was only $29 per person for appetizer entree and dessert. Best meal we had in Vegas by far--some people want to put down Bobby Flay because of his celebrity food network status but do NOT pay attention to those reviews. I recommend the duck appetizer and the scallops.\n\nFantastic!",1,positive
Lunch buffet $10.99. Yummy garlic naan!!,1,positive
"This is more like $$$$ but well worth it. \nBefore we got the bill my boyfriend did say this was the best meal he ever had. So it was well worth it, plus what was ordered was at market value. duh.. \n\nThe service was great I believe our waiter was Brian... \nHe was very chill and treated us great! We are looking forward to going back soon.",1,positive
My husband I go here at least once a week and we went on Fathers Day. Was surprised they raised the price and still had the same food they always do.  It was still awesome though. the best part is you get to eat all the sushi you want.,1,positive
"Prices were very cheap for the late night specials. However, service was terrible. Lucky for them, they already include gratuity in large parties; otherwise, I would have left a mediocre tip.",0,negative
"Had dinner there this weekend.  I ordered the Pork Tenderloin, which turned out to be pork loin.  Dry, tough, chewy.  My date had the scallops, which from what I tasted was bland.  Seriously, the mashed potatoes were the highlight of dinner.\n\nThe bill came to on the order of $40, including iced tea.  For the money, Denny's is a much better option.  Don't think I'll be back.",0,negative
"Pricey but worth it!\n\nI have yet to find something as good as the Lobster Bisque served here, simply delicious.  I ordered the 24 oz steak to split with my friend, a side of lobster mashed potatoes and a watermelon margarita, all of which were delicious. The meal exceeded $100.00 but well worth it as everything was prepared perfectly and served in a timely manner.",1,positive
"We had the all you can eat BBQ ribs for $15.99.  The sides were corn, corn bread and mashed potatoes.  The ribs tasted like they were old and just kept warm over the weekend, with a cheap BBQ sauce straight from a jar.  No grilled flavor at all.   I specically asked if one of the veggies were green and the waiter said yes, veggies are included.  I don't think he understood what we asked.   \n\nHubby finally just returned his and got a salad, I wish I would have also. \nThe $10 margarita pitcher was nice.",0,negative
"It is not worth the price of $40+ per person. there is nothing for you to eat, but a few tacos and pasta and cookies and cakes. Save your money and go elsewhere",0,negative
"We actually had a coupon for 25 dollars off.... we had 2 bottles of wine, crab cakes and two entrees... with the coupon it was around 100 bucks (including tip)  Very good food.

"My wife and I went to Cravings while in town for our anniversary. We showed up around 4:30, and were charged the lower \""""early bird\"""" rate. There was plenty to choose from. The star of the show was the Prime Rib.  The prime rib was very tender and moist, as was the carved roast turkey.  I had to grab seconds on the prime rib.  Decent ribs, bbq chicken, sushi.  I skipped the pizza. You can get pizza anywhere right? I ended up eating three plates, and managing to find a little room for dessert.",1,positive
"I reserved a table through open table. The reservation was just right. I requested a table with a great view, and we received it. The food was visually stunning and quite tasty. It was a bit expensive. If you are going to have a drink and some wine with dinner, be prepared to spend about $100 a person.",1,positive
Too pricey for the food. The meal I had was just ok. My MIL had a terrible loud garlic pasta. It was stinky. They were also not too happy to see my two kids in tow.,0,negative
"We came for dinner and paid $33 per person.  The food was okay, improvement can be made.  It can be expanded.  I've been to Bellagio's buffet which is 10 times better than Bayside.  I will not come back again to Bayside.  It is way overprice for $33.  Small selection from salad bar, main entrees to dessert.  I was unhappy.",0,negative
"I wonder how much it would cost to get these guys as a personal chef?\n\nDined at Salt of the Earth on Saturday evening without reservations and we waited for 2 drinks (maybe 45 minutes? 60? ehhh who knows). Communal seating makes finding out what is good for the evening that much easier since the menu changes daily.\n\nTIP: If you see something on the board you wan (food or drink), order it! Quantities are limited! We saw our entree get erased immediately after ordering ;-)\n\nmmmm When can I go back?",1,positive
"I got the daily special that included 5 wings, fries, a drink, and a Hawaiian roll all for $7. I got garlic Parmesan and they literally used the Parmesan in a bottle that you can get at Walmart. To be honest I could make these wings at home. The fries were decent and the Hawaiian roll was good. Nothing really special about this place. \n\nI also got a free desert for checking in here on yelp. I got the peach cobbler and it was pretty good and probably the best thing I got out of my whole meal.",0,negative
The nile was too overpriced for what we got.  The food tasted decent but not worth the bill:0,0,negative
"Bleh it was free with room and I also got comped so got to enjoy 3 buffets each(lucky me ugh)  They serve the same food for lunch and dinner daily for $20 each I would have been really mad if I had to pay for it. There were a couple of good things mashed potatoes and gravy was yummy, chinese noodles and a good salad choice.",0,negative
Very disappointed this year (2014). Both fish dinners had strong fish. Unlike in the past cheap salad dressing used (Ken's). Another major disappointment was that the pistachio Greek casserole was NOT included in the meals this year. All this with an increased admission price to $3 per person. My family won't be back next year!\n\nKarl M.,0,negative
"Coupon for the free dinner was so worth it\nAll u can eat garlic filet mignon, tender pork tenderloin, bacon wrapped turkey\nThe meats are excellent and leave you stuffed. They just need to be a little more clear on how the coupon works but it's definitely worth it",1,positive
"I think this will be the last time I come back and I've been eating here for 10 years.  It's now $33 a person.  For $150 for the four of us, I can find better places in Vegas for Sushi.  It's good, but not great.  when it was $20 a head, it was more \""""appetizing\"""", now, not so much.  \n\nHeck, the Bellagio Buffet is cheaper now and they have King Crab legs!",0,negative
"After reading reviews, my wife and I decided to dine here one day following an exhausting 4000 mile driving trip from which had not yet fully recovered. We dined on the noon buffet which was very tasty, varied and well presented. The price was a promotional one for their recent opening ($15.15 with tax for two), Servers were very welcoming, attentive and engaging. The naan was especially good and the vindaloo was appropriately spicy. Highly recommended.",1,positive
"Had a coupon for buying tickets to bite which got us a huge slice of pizza and a beer for 5 bucks. Cant beat that. The pizza was actually really good. The meaty slice had meatballs, italian suasage, bacon and pepperoni. Great food for the price",1,positive
"It's bang for your buck here anytime.  Two deals here- 7.77 for a steak and shrimp dinner and a 9.99 for an all you can eat prime rib dinner! What more can you ask for?\n\nI've tried the steak and shrimp dinner the other day.  It was excellent for the price.  The meat was perfectly cooked and a pretty good cut. Service is decent, but a bit rushed..",1,positive
"This is very good food and the Filet to die for ... But you probably will, when you pay your ticket. Ate there with the wife, and for two people al-a-carte, it ran us about or close too, $200 bucks. It was really good,like bomb. But so was the price of dinner. I could of bought a week's worth of groceries for the two of us. But it was time for a treat. So, I treated her or us. The service was great along with the food.The atmosphere was nice and cozy as well. Enjoyed our time and the good eats. Thx",1,positive
"Used a Groupon and glad I did. I get it, there in the Palazzo but $50 bucks for 2 burgers, 1 fry, and 1 drink? The burgers were good as well as filling, but not the best I have had. The fries, well, they have to do something about those. Come up with a different variety or something. Lame and wimpy about half way into dinner.  It's an okay place, but would I do it twice? Nope...",0,negative
"Those $.25 hooter wings are the best!!!!  We also ordered the prime rib special for $9.95 and shared and it was not half bad.  Oh man, it came with the corn bread muffin which had particles of real corn and some jalapenos and had a good amount of sweetness but not too much.  That my friend was just heaven - especially when you are drunk.  \n\nBill came up to $25 with tax tip and two beers.  Who could beat that?",1,positive
"This place is huge! They have a nice selection of frozen food, fresh food, and dried food.\n\nStayed in vegas for the weekend, and our suite had a kitchen. What better way than to stock the kitchen with food for $1.\n\nMany of the foods you can find here are found in normal stores for $2 or $3 more. What a steal!",1,positive
"So we ate here for our last breakfast before we left. Tuesday morning, we caught the end of breakfast, and then got lunch. The food was mediocre, but for the price wasn't too bad. $21.99 for adults. They had the basics pizza, meat, mash potatoes, fruit, Asian, Mexican, etc. Not a lot of choices for the vegetarian, at least I didn't think so. And many varieties of dessert, all you can drink is extra, we didn't opt for it. This was fine cause we were their, but over all we won't be back.",0,negative
"Have been here a few times now, both for dinner and for breakfast.  Huge servings, reasonable price around $10/person per entree, except for over night shifts. Overnight breakfast is around $2.\n\nWill certainly recommend.  Like steak, try the $10 steak dinner!",1,positive
"Minimum sucks, be careful what u order. Plan what u will eat and drink or it will bit ya. But all in all great place!",1,positive
"I definitely enjoyed Craftsteak. I ended up ordering the braised lobster and risotto. I thought both were good but lobster at $70 was a little expensive for this low roller. I went with a party of 7, we all enjoyed the experience.",1,positive
"Pricey at $45 each (plus tip for someone bringing drinks)and alcohol costs extra, for dinner.  But that's average compared to every other place around. Excellent food & selection. Prime rib, crab legs & dry rub ribeye were worth the price alone. The desserts are wonderful - we tried 10 or more &they were all yummy!  Mac & cheese & truffle scalloped potatoes were amazing too.",1,positive
"I use to do take out from this place when I lived on the west side. It was about $9 for their buffet take out and they gave you a container and basically you filled it up until you couldn't stuff it anymore, which I graciously did. I found a place on the East side that reminds me of them and the food is just as good. Plus I always had enough for leftovers for the next day. Call me greedy but hey, it is a buffet and its ok to be greedy from time to time lol.",1,positive
1 meal serves 2!! Very generous portion! Prices are reasonable. ..you pay for what you get...Delicious!!\n\nService was fast. Waiter was really friendly and accommodating.  Unique / relaxing ambiance,1,positive
"Went there with a coupon for buy 1 get 1 free buffet for $19.99 with 3 other people.  Got the bill and it was $110.00.  Found out that the 2 for 1 meant that they cut the price from $44.90 to $19.99 meaning 2 meals for the price of 1.  Poorly worded and misleading coupon.  Service was decent, coupon made me feel otherwise.  Especially after our waiter told us the bill would only be a little more than $44 with the coupon.",0,negative
"Great value for a no-frills prime rib dinner. For $12 we got a generous cut of prime rib, a salad, a side, green beans and a beer. \n\nExactly what you expect when looking for cheap eats in vegas.",1,positive
"Went here with 3 of my friends for vacation. Each meal was pretty cheap at $12 each; the waiter was really nice offering to bring two bowls of rice and two baskets of bread which we didn't know costs us $15. Add in the 18% automatic gratuity on alcoholic beverages and you get $115. That was a surprise to me. The food itself was ok, nothing spectacular. I would have rather spent that money on a buffet or something else.",0,negative
"After our not so great experience at Shibuya, the following evening we decided to try Pearl.

"Don't do it. Way too expensive for the portions. Yes, it's tapas, but so tiny at $12 a plate. It should be more like $6-$9 even if it is swanky Las Vegas at the newest hotel. Plus, we found it odd that the food came out instantly. Clearly not made to order. After spending $100 here, we left hungry enough to go back upstairs to order room service.  There's better places to go. Don't be a sucker.",0,negative
"We were recommended the \""""special\"""" by our server - paella and tapas. Good food, not great. Much of the seafood was over cooked. When we got the bill, we almost choked - $378 for a table of five! One pitcher of sangria and one bottle of wine. We had even told the waiter to bring us the chaper wine because we didn't want to spend too much on dinner.",0,negative

"Went with a group of 6 for dinner and it wasn't very full.  Its in the Forum Shops and its kinda far to walk to but its worth it.  The food was good and the service was as well.  We all had cocktails, apps and dinners and it came out to about $500.  The seafood sampler was very good and we had two at the table so we definitely ordered well for ourselves!  The steak was very good as well.",1,positive

There is one in July every year and one in the winter but Im not sure when.  The website lists participating restaurants and you can book right from there on open table.  They all provide a 3 course meal for $30.  This year we did Aria and The Peculiar Rabbit and both were awesome.  Such a fun way to try new restaurants.,1,positive
"Im not going to lie this is one of the most expensive asian resturants ive been too.\nbut it was something different from the fast food, americam and buffet we were having in vegas. i loved the design of the resturant! very different compared to lots of other asian resturant you'll go too. expect to put out about 18-22 dollars for each plate or so for a small portion. Food was served out fast but tasted okay! serving was great!",0,negative
I'd spend the night at Tuscany and got a buy one get one free entree coupon and used it here. The french toast complete is good deal. I'd split it with my sister and we were both full. Service is also vry friendly. Total was ~$8. Great deal if you get the coupon.,1,positive
visited for lunch after a morning of car shopping. I had the pad thai w/ chicken which was delicious and enormous. I overate & still had plenty left to take home. Hubby had cashew chicken which also was delicious but just enough for a moderate to large appetite (no leftovers). Add a thai tea & our bill was $21,1,positive
"my husband took me here on my birthday and it was probably one of the best meals i've ever eaten.  getting the wagyu skirt steak was the best decision i made.  a pricey steak, but i don't think i'll ever eat a steak as delicious as that one.  we both had steak entrees, a couple sides, a cocktail and a dessert.  dinner was about $200... well worth it.  not something i would do all the time, but a great treat!",1,positive
Great hh here. $3 appetizer menu!  The quality was pretty good too. Drinks r only .50$ off tho,1,positive
Ok. I didn't go for a meal just the happy hour. Went for the chips and salsas$2.95. Great deal. Also had two margaritas. Well made at only $5 each. You can sit in front and people watch. Fun,1,positive
So start off the grounds weren't kept up very well and it it's in downtown Phoenix.  this place wants a $1500 outside catering fee or or you can pay $26 per plate for any type of food which means that they arent good at making any specific type of food.  Charges for September and December are cheaper but are more expensive than the nice places in Scottsdale.  If you're looking for a wedding or just a reception or any event for that matter don't go here.,0,negative
"We got free dinner and a show from hotel. They have a separate menu for these 'free' meals. They did offer to give credit toward full price item on regular menu. \n\nFood was good. The'spicy' tilapia that I had was not spicy, but I think the blackening is probably enough that some people may find it spicy. \n\nWe would not have gone there on our own. The free meal was good to get us to look at menu and choose it. Drinks tip and tax are not included.",1,positive
"overpriced.\npaying for the experience and the nice wait staff.\n\n$28/lb of shrimp fajitas. nice but more than we would like to spend.\nextra tortillas. lots of grilled onions. mild sauce.\n\nwe saw lots of little kids, surprised families could afford it, suspect it is a very special outing for most people so economy is not the issue.\n\ngood smells \ncomfortable surroundings\nvery attentive staff.\nprobably desires a 3 star but $20+ per person bugs me.",0,negative
"Went on a Sunday afternoon for Lunch and it was like $50 bucks.

"So last Monday the hubs and I got invited out to join some friends for $3 burgers at Maizies ($4 if you add cheese)\n\nFor 4 burgers (All with cheese on them) and 4 beers our total bill was only $30!!!!!!!! That is a smoking deal if I ever did see one! \n\nOur burgers came out fast and hot. They serve them on chibata bread! They give you a little side of chipotle mayo that is delicious, but not enough to cover a burger.\n\n\nOur waiter was super fast and friendly! We will for sure be going back",1,positive
"Alex is so expensive! I ate with my uncle and there was like 8 of us for $2000! It was really good though, except for the goose liver. EWww! I know I'll probably never eat there again though. Super classy, romantic type environment. Hahaha. The portions are really small, but in a good way because you get to try a lot of different things. Flavor's pretty strong too so it gets overwhelming if one dish was the whole meal.",1,positive

I finally made it here to try their Fried Chicken. I didn't feel like eating solo today so I just ordered it to go.\n\nFried Chicken - Dark (leg and thigh)\n includes 3 sides and cornbread\n  -mac and cheese\n  -mashed potatoes\n  -fried cabbage\n\nThe chicken was fried perfectly. It was not greasy like the chicken you get from Popeyes. The sides were all very good. The cornbread was just ok.\n\nThere was also a sign on the register listing their lunch specials for $7 between 11am-3pm.,1,positive
"Best(healthiest) chicken around!  The ribs are even better. Great sides friendly staff, very casual. I live in the neighborhood and can't resist, when I drive by. Check yelp for coupons and have twice as much!!",1,positive
"VERY good!  The food is SO tasty!  It's a wee bit pricey, but YUM!  Think Chipotle or Qdoba and kick it up a notch.  The food quality is HIGH; you get what you pay for, but $30 for lunch for two with no drinks is a little much for a daily driver.  But I will go back.  Delish!  Get the cajun fish bowl.  OMG!",1,positive
"Love Raising Cane's. I ordered the Box and ate it all. Super delicious chicken and Texas toast. The fries are ehhh but everything else, including the people that work here, is good. My only complaint is the small parking lot. It gets pretty busy here sometimes and it's hard to find a spot.",1,positive
"I use to go to Logan's in Tennessee when I was in the army. I'd normally get so sloshed it didn't matter what the food tasted like, but now the chain has been in AZ for a while and I no longer drink. This place has good rolls and sweet tea. That's it. Don't expect much here.",0,negative
"Looking for Cajun? Look no further. My favorites are the etufee and gumbo. I stopped in on a Friday night and had the pork chop special, it had to be the biggest and most tender chop I've had! For those of you looking for a classic dirty rice they took me back to a LA coonass swap party. The live guitar sole was a great addition for back ground music.",1,positive
"Discovered this place a few weeks ago, I have only had their chicken fingers, but  they are awesome! The fingers battered kind of like \""""raising canes,\"""" but they offer hot sauces and ranch, and canes does not. I have been here 3 or 4 times, and the service was always great and fast. I would give this place 5 stars, but the ranch dressing is a little on the watery side, but still very good.",1,positive
"So I accidentally found this spot after getting groceries while on vacation in Vegas.   Like most Jamaican spots it's a small mom and pops place. Don't expect glitz and glamour, just some good old fashion fresh Jamaican food. I've had the jerk chicken, oxtails, chicken and goat curry and chx patties (not all on the same day) everything was great!  When home in Cali I eat at Lee's and Jammin, this was on the same level.  I know when I visit Vegas again I will stop by and eat up....",1,positive
Bar Crudo is FABULOUS!!!!!!! We are from NYC and have been having trouble finding restaurants that are consistently good. Bar Crudo is consistently GREAT!!!!!!!

WE LOVE CRUDO!!!!!!!!,1,positive
"I love traditional native American fry bread and this place does a great job as well.  I ordered the green chilli stew and loved the spicy flavor could not stop eating it and loved dipping the fry bread in the chilli.  My wife ordered the Pozole and loved it, again great natural authentic southwest flavors whats not to love.  The only negatives are non food issues in my opinion.  Limited drink selection, and close far too early for a downtown Saturday night in my opinion (9pm)!",1,positive
"I am not usually a fan of fast food, but I will give Raising Cane's a pretty solid score.  It is very clean inside and very attentative service.  A very limited menu offering but solid food.  The chicken is moist and succulent and the fries are the typical frozen fries.  You do have to wait a few minutes for your food though.  They are cooking it a la minute (to order).  I am pleased with these guys so I will go back!",1,positive
"Stopped here once with my brother-in-law and his two kids. Staff was great. Portions were larger than expected. Completely different atmosphere than Cajun Queen, but in our opinion  the food at Razzoo's is better.",1,positive
By far the BEST chicken tenders in town!! You'll throw rocks at Canes after you try Mochiko Chicken. Do yourself a favor and get down there...you won't be disappointed! Don't forget to wash down your chicken with their famous lychee lemonade!,1,positive
"Great food and service, nuff said. I enjoyed the Piedmont omelette and creamy grits that are delicious and slightly different than classic grits. The biscuits are also outstanding.",1,positive
"Look - My wife likes this place so I go there now and again just to make her happy. I know it violates the bro code, but I have to sleep with her.\nMe personally, I could care less about Jack Daniels sauce (which is basically reconstituted dried onion and molasses with some other'secret' ingredients.\nToo costly for what you get. 2 thumbs down.",0,negative

I adore Tupelo Honey. Every time someone visits me I take them to Tupelo for brunch. The cocktails are amazing and the food is no exception. I especially love that they sell their merchandise. I purchased the pecans and honey for my grandfather for Father's Day and he was a big fan!,1,positive
"Farm food with a twist! I like! If this is farm food from Indiana, then I'm going to love Indiana!\n\nI didn't expect this place to be THAT good. We ordered the Corned Beef, which came with two eggs, roasted potatoes, biscuit, and fruits. The other plate we ordered was the Andy's Sage Chicken with maple reductions, two eggs, bacon mash potatoes, biscuit, and fruits. WOW! The portions were ridiculously huge! The service was quick and friendly! \n\nThere needs to be a Hash House A Go Go in L.A. or Long Beach!",1,positive
"I think I'm in love. Seriously. Raising Cane WHO? The Grilled and Fried strips were my favorite. AMAZING! The baked Mac n Cheese was like Velveeta on crack. The garlic toast mmmmmm . Wish it wasn't so far from my house, but well worth the drive!",1,positive
I liked this place when I lived in AZ.  I really liked the Orange Peel Chicken with the brown rice....the only thing I didn't like there was the fried spinach (yuck).\n\nThe drinks there were pretty good too.,1,positive
"As previous reviews have mentioned, this place has a very laid-back a la Caribbean feel, as it should.  The jerk chicken & pork meal was large and very satisfying.  The flavors were subtle, yet kept you interested in the meal.  I loved that they had some Jamaican products you can purchase right there and home-made hot sauce served with the food was amazing! Will definitely go back when in Madison!",1,positive
Houston's is incredible!!!!!! Spinach artichoke dip so good the incredible filet mignon. Like butter and delicious. Service was excellent and the food was brought out with perfect timing. What a great place that I can't wait to visit again.,1,positive
"I grew up in NE Indiana until I was 18 and this place definitely has mid-west styled meals. Great food, unique atmosphere, and great prices. I've taken my family and many of my friends and everyone really likes it and asks me to take them back. This place is hands down my favorite place to get breakfast.",1,positive
"I love how there are a variety of menu options here (vs. Hot N Juicy), and their cajun sause is so unique...it's tasty and DELICIOUS!!  The service here is wonderful, as they are always upbeat, happy, polite, and care about your dining experience.",1,positive
Great variety - good for families - perfect Fried Chicken!,1,positive
"Second time visiting and it's even better than last time. The hush puppies get two thumbs up, really great and spiced so well. The chicken pieces are a bit small, if you ask me, but still delicious. I love southern fried chicken and this is delicious. Service with a smile.",1,positive
Love this place but they are a little overpriced!!! The sauce is what makes the chicken taste even better! Raising canes is fab. 4 stars due to prices!,1,positive
Im a South Point regular so I have eaten at S&S countless times.  The service is always friendly and attentive and the bugers are sooooo good.  For $3.99 you can't go wrong.  I have the double when I go.  The lines are long but its worth it and the value makes it 5 stars.,1,positive
Best chicken and waffles I ve had. The Mac and cheese is to die for. Lolos is by far better then roscoes in LA.,1,positive
"This place not only lives up to its reviews, it surpasses it!  The sauces are amazing, and the food is so fresh,  everything is fantastic here!  We arrived during the happy hour which featured several of the main dishes in smaller portions, so we decided to order several dishes.. We tried the Cajun albacore, the hydro black cod, the firecracker roll, the shrimp tempura, the baked mussels, the beef tadas and the salmon avocado roll...  Yum yum yum!   We will definitely be returning here regularly!  Well done Chef Lee!",1,positive

"This may be Southern Fusion, but not true Southern (try Dish for that!). GF has been here many times for lunch and loves it. First time for dinner:\n\nWe both got the meatloaf, veggies and mash taters - excellent. 2 meals, beer, and wine - $35.",1,positive
"So I think that I have a tie between my opinion of best Cajun/Creole food in AZ and its between Chez Monieux and Baby Kay's in Phoenix. This place had awesome Boudin balls for appetizers. I love boudin so much! When I lived in Louisiana I ate boudin like it was going out of style. The way I test good Cajun joints is by getting my favorite dish, Crawfish Etouffee and this place has it RIGHT! It was amazing! Go check this place out if you want some authentic cajun food.",1,positive
Yuck..\n\nI thought it was related to Cracker Barrel Cheese. It's a cute country style store.. if you are looking for candy from the past and rockers..but do not go for food\n\nThey do have a really good Sweet Tea..\n\nSay no the dumpling and chicken! I've never had it so I had to try but now I wish I didn't!,0,negative
"I've driven past this place about a hundred times and always wanted to stop. With it being Restaurant Week and every other restaurant in the city booked up, I decided tonight was the night. The restaurant itself is really small. Has a local, neighborhood feel. Food was great. American and Seafood mostly. True southern charm in the wait staff. I had the shrimp with Mac n cheese and broccoli. Didn't save room for dessert but those sounded great.",1,positive
"Have been to this and the Scottsdale location several times. Good food and laid back atmosphere. Sometimes you might have to wait longer than you would like for a refill or to pay your bill, but generally the service is decent. \n\nI usually get the fried catfish plate with Mac n cheese and greens. Have also tried the waffle sandwich. Stepped outside the box once or twice and got the shrimp n grits and the salmon croquettes. Not impressed with either. Also wish they had peach cobbler.",1,positive

"It's bomb. Get a box combo, switch out the cole slaw, and bring me the other canes sauce. \nUNLV students, don't forget to show your Rebelcard and get that discount. At this location only!",1,positive
"The only chicken place I had really been to around this area was Popeyes. A friend took me here the other day and wow. The food is great. I ordered the caniac, it was so much food for 9 dollars! The fact that you can also substitute the cole slaw for another piece of the amazing Texas toast is awesome. The fries are also really good! I will be making a return to this location, the workers were really friendly and I think next time I'll get the 4 piece instead of 6 haha. :)",1,positive
Classic feeling southern food. I enjoyed my chicken and dumplings more than most places.... take that Cracker Barrel!,1,positive
"I've only gone for lunch. There is a lot of variety, the food is always fresh, and I've yet to be disappointed. I think they do daily specials in addition to the regular top sirloin, pork, and turkey... I still have to figure out which specials they put out for each day. I will say, though, that their fried chicken is in my top 3 best fried chicken I've ever eaten, no joke. I hope the next time I go, it'll be fried chicken day.",1,positive
"I've lived here all my life and never even heard of this place. We went here for a work outing and they have very unique food. Their stetson chopped salad is something I've never had anywhere, and it is very good. I won't spoil it for people but if you go, order it and taste it for yourself. It is supposed to be western fusion, but I really don't sense that. Especially when I ordered the Korean ribs! \n\n\nVisited January 2012",1,positive
"Who would've thought that a fast food place that \""""specializes\"""" in chicken tenders would be such a hit? Well, Cane's did! \n\nI'd say that it's a place that is comparable, if you've ever had it, to Chik-fil-a. The tenders are so full of flavor from the breading to the meat itself. I don't know what they call their sauce but it's not bad, pretty peppery, I like it. \n\nIt was pretty cute how they decked out the place for Halloween. Service was good, they were pretty nice here.",1,positive
"Well, i did not like the food at this place much at all, well maybe because I'm not a huge soul food fan. Fried chicken was OK but very greasy and the oxtail was very fatty and it was deep friend and smothered with gravy didn't really taste anything special about it, it was just salty and fatty. I went to this place to try the gumbo but unfortunately it wasn't available on the day, so i might go there ones more to try that but not sure.",0,negative
I love raising canes there chicken fingers & sweet tea are delicious & I was so happy when they were building this location because it is only about 5-10 minutes away from my house but the past 5 times I have come they have messed up my order! Get it together Canes!,0,negative
"What a lovely, fortuitous, delicious find! I was traveling for work and couldn't handle any more nasty road trip food. This place was lovely, the food was fabulous, and if absolutely go again.\n\nThe only downer was that the peach cobbler was less than meh. I'm a southern girl who is particular about her cobblers.",1,positive
"AKA daily chicken! Food's good, so is the hookah.",1,positive
"Came here from North Carolinas. The bartenders were really friendly. If you are coming from out of town I suggest you sample as many as you can. I love jalape\u00f1os and the El Heffe was amazing. Oh yea, go ahead and try that gourmet popcorn. Thanks for showing a southern girl a good time guys.",1,positive
"Best chicken and waffles EVER!! yes, even better than Roscoe's (and trust me, i LOVE Roscoe's). There's bacon and chives IN THE WAFFLES!! Add Tahitian Vanilla Bean Butter to that, some special gravy, and PERFECTLY fried pieces of chicken, OOOOOOOOOO!! I'm drooling just thinking about it. Very good for brunch!\n\nIt's a journey trying to find this place though, but that makes it better! it's a hidden gem!",1,positive
"I absolutely love the food here. With the perfect mix of fresh, delicious cajun food and eclectic decor in an old, historic house turned restaurant, you really can't go wrong. The parking can be a pain on weekend evenings and the quarters can be quite tight, for these reasons I typically visit Cajun Queen on weekday nights. The fried oysters are my favorite - and I typically don't do fried!",1,positive
"Love this place! I wish we can get some Cracker Barrels in Cali! had the Mama's french toast meal.. so Delicious! I thinks my only complaint would be the sausage patties, I get the size for the kids meals but for an adult meal? Anyway, can't go to Az without a stop at good 'ol Cracker Barrel, will definately be back next time I'm in town!",1,positive
"Love Zaxby's, copied the sauce for home made chicken strips. I've been to many in several states, the quality of food/service is very close. Dependable good eats from NC to Ga.",1,positive
Take it from a real live coonass cajun...This ain't it. Dumping a ton of cayenne pepper on something does NOT make it Louisiana!,0,negative
"Chicken strips... good. Buffalo sauce... good. Sweet tea... good! I love the uber-cheery staff, super easy and tasty menu, and those two pickles on the original chicken sandwich.",1,positive
I visited the original location first and a few months later stumbled upon this location while out with my husband. This place is great. The wait can be pretty long but it is worth it. The shrimp & grits are heavenly and their pancakes are wHOO! Great!,1,positive
"can't beat the tempura chicken strips. the prime rib dip with au jus is tough to top. you just can't really go wrong at any houston's. just one thing - FOR GOD'S SAKE - DO NOT order a bloody mary because they have no FUCKING IDEA how to make one. that is the only qualm i have with THIS houston's. any one in atlanta, dallas, new orleans - any place in the south - knows how to make a bloody mary. someone needs to let this houston's know that the first ingredient is ICE! c'mon, houston's!",1,positive
"I was pretty hesitant about this place since Joe's Crab Shack was pretty disgusting so assumed it may be similar. I was sooo wrong. This place is soo good!  The trifecta sauce is AWESOME!! I love the heat level. The medium has pretty decent heat but if you love spicey go for the hot. I had the gumbo, clams, shrimp, and snow crab and they we're all terrific. I'm definitely returning.",1,positive
"Wanted to eat here for a long time, was not disappointed. Large portions, great comfort food the way it is suppose to be. Shared the Moist Pork Chops, Fried Catfish, Fried Chicken. The sides are great also, cornbread, potato salad and mac & cheese and of course kool aid. We were fortunate there was no wait and also had parking available. The portions were very generous and actually made 2 1/2 meals. The staff was friendly and very helpful on deciding what to order. Can't wait to go back. You have to try this iconic place.",1,positive
"Having eaten here about 5 times (3 drive throughs), I must say Memphis does not disappoint. Every single time, I've been happy with what I ordered - chili, ribs, pulled pork sandwich, cole slaw, etc Don't know why there are bad reviews, maybe I just got lucky? It helps that this is right across the wide street from where we work-very convenient. Sorry 'bout the other folks that must've caught it on a bad day. Anyway, now that we're Las Vegans who love meat ;-), Memphis is just fine by us.....",1,positive
"The location is clean but pretty bare-bones, but the staff is very friendly and the  food is awesome. The ribs are smoky, tender and not greasy or over-sauced. The garlic potato wedges are to die for, several steps above the usual fries. The beans seemed from a can and there weren't any greens on the menu but the food was affordable and very satisfying. If Momma was southern, this would be like home cooking!",1,positive
"Delicious! When I'm craving a good ol American burger this is my favorite place....made to order,  fresh toppings of your choice,  Cajun fries are seasoned well and full of flavor (servings are plentiful-perfect for sharing) \nOh and free shelled peanuts to munch on!\nAlways great service =)",1,positive
"Had there moolas yesterday.  Excellent, will drive here to get them again, the al pastor was dripping with flavor.",1,positive
We have eaten at Buck and Honey's several times and have not been disappointed yet! Good food and good service!,1,positive
when i go here my double double is always extra tasty as well as hot did go inside after eating in the parking lot on a nice summer evening and they're lemonade was bone dry,1,positive
"Love this place.,would definitely recommend the Irish stew and Shepherds pie!!  Perfectly seasoned and the beef in the stew was very tender...our waitress was friendly and efficient. ...wish they would open up a restaurant in Houston!",1,positive
"Raising Cane's is awesome. I always order the Big Box, The Fingers are made fresh and come out HOT. So its best to let them cool off for a bit. The French Fries are good, offering Onion RIngs wouldnt be a bad thing. The Staff are always friendly and checking to make sure everything is ok. Something about the sauce. I prefer the Sweet Tea. You wont be disappointed.",1,positive
Lived in Missouri for 14 years and Steak and Shake is a staple so when we saw that South Point had steak and shake we were excited.. It didnt let us down pretty crowded but the food was great.  We dine in and also had take out .  !!,1,positive
"We have gone to this place twice and I have to say it would be one of the only two reasons I would go back to Food Truck Friday. The caramelized sugar is delicious.  If they are there go their first. You won't be disappointed.  I also agree it is the \""""best cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e that I've ever had.\"""" Get the sea salt, so good.",1,positive
The best chicken and waffles I've ever had.  Puts Roscoe's to shame!,1,positive
"This Yankee really loved this place. Led here by Yelp reviews and a desire for southern cuisine, we were very happy with the choice. Fried green tomatoes, shrimp and grits, pimento cheese, great beer selection - can't wait to move down here so we can come back. Yum!",1,positive
went there today got to meet flava and the chicken was great not over seasoned or over priced i will be back      happy b day flav,1,positive
"This place has some great food. I haven't yet found anything on the menu that I don't like instantly. The pizza, the sandwiches, the appetizers, the desserts... all good. Despite this, my favorite item on the menu is definitely the Berry Burst Cider. I haven't yet found any other decent cider in the valley.\n\nAtmosphere: good\nService: good\n\nMy only beef: I did once have the jambalaya and that simply left me wanting authentic Cajun.",1,positive
"I've been going to Pete's with my family on AZ roadtrips for as long as I can remember, so I know these well:\n\nThe rules:\n\nNo  debit or credit cards\nNo checks\nNo 50s or 100s\nNo separate orders\nNo ketchup--don't even ask.\nNo Sundays\nNo feeding the pigeons\nClean up after yourself, your mother does not work here.\n\nSo bossy, so cheap, so mouth-wateringly delicious. Forget about your precious ketchup, Pete's Special Sauce knocks my socks off. Careful with parking, it can be cutthroat--especially on Fridays.",1,positive
"after a long day of gambling and drinking, a house gumbo with a pepsi makes me forget that i lost all my money playing penny slots.  look past the off the strip hotel, everyone is over the age 45 and the sound of keno in the background and you'll get a down to earth restaurant that serves quality southern style food.  pan roast, gumbo, jumbolia, you cant go wrong.  everything is cooked in front of you in a steel pot where its simmer to perfection.",1,positive
"I used to go to the location on EVB; been going to Honey Bear's since the early 90's...Love Honey Bears; it's great they are in Central PHX (closer to me now); I see they have Greens on the menu (but, they were out yesterday)...Will be back; for the Fried Chicken (on Wednesdays) & some Greens...Also, wish they had Fried Green Tomatoes...",1,positive
I'm going to have to say this is one of my favorite places to eat in the burgh. I am going to give it a 5 star chitty chitty bang bang rating. I had the seafood combo and it was delecticable. The chicken soup was out of this world. Service was quick and friendly. It definitely hit the spot on all notes. I will most certainly return.,1,positive

"I grew up in the 60's and 70's in Michigan and I can say that the Hoosier cafe brought back memories.  Days when my dad and I used to sneak out of the house on Sunday for a great breakfast. The Gravy is thick and packed with sausage.  Eggs cooked perfectly, and Hash browns crispy on the outside and tender in the center. Oh and the bottomless cup of coffee!\n\nBring back memories from the old days...",1,positive
"So far it is the best soul food place in Queen creek,but they will have more items on the menu.the chicken is the bomb.",1,positive
"What a perfect name for this place. Hot N Juicy, exactly how everything is. We got the crawfish, whole shrimp and sausage all in the HNJ Special (combination of all the different flavor) seasoning, Fired Catfish basket and Etoufee. All were seasoned and cooked perfectly. There was nothing left when we were done. Great wait staff, they explained the menu well learning we were first time customer. Oh yeah, don't forget to put on your bibs.",1,positive
"Cannot believe I have lived next to this place for years and never tried it! Went for lunch today and the sliders (one pork, one beef and one chicken) were AMAZING! Their mac n cheese was bomb too, not to mention the Big Red. Will definitely start eating here regularly.",1,positive
sometimes you just want to go to an old fashioned country style restaraunt and order some biscuits n gravy and don't need all the over the top fixins some of the other places put (hint hint: snooze putting carrots in their gravy realllllyyyyy?!?!?!?!) in their dishes. the place serves generous size portions and I am a fan!,1,positive
Incredibly delicious food full of lively cajun flavors and spices.  Wait staff was friendly and informative.   My only complaint was I was still very hungry after finishing my meal.  I highly recommend the bronze shrimp and grits but the real treat ( that everyone should experience) is the bananas foster bread pudding!,1,positive
"Arnold Palmers with southern-style sweet tea? Check! \nDog treats given out in the drive-through when they see a furball in the car? Yes!\nAmusing, if cheesy, welcomes to the restaurant?  Indeed!\nPleasant staff?  Yep! \nTasty food at reasonable prices?  That too!\n\nWhen I'm not feeling up to cooking, this is my go-to place for sure.",1,positive
"Surprisingly a not so great place for meatheads to eat. Food is really greasy. That's probably the main ingredient, grease. They drown everything in fats and their cajun spices to mask the mediocrity of their other ingredients. I would not recommend this place but it's not inedible.",0,negative

I love their croissants and their staff is always awesome. their chicken strips are awesome. i love their grilled chicken and veggies, too. \n\nThey have an awesome blackened grilled chicken, they don't use oil to cook either which is a plus! they no longer have it on the menu but have never given me a problem ordering it!\n\nyay for charlestons!",1,positive
We love this place!! My husband and I visited New Orleans last Feb. and this place is quite authentic!! Lots of fired food but that's the best part.\nI had the fried catfish and shrimp basket and it was very good. My husband had the fried craw fish and the dip that came with it was very good. Almost like a bar b que but with a little something extra. Definitely worth the try. We will be returning!!,1,positive
"All about their fried chicken! Went here last Sun on the way back from hiking at Sedona. Hubby ordered the 2 piece fried with Yucca fries & I ordered the 2 piece Grilled Chicken with rice & Plantains. The star was the fried Chicken, but the Yucca fries came close second. The Grilled Chicken was kind of bland in my opinion. Overall their Fried Chicken is worth 5 stars & worth another visit while in town",1,positive
"AKA daily chicken! Food's good, so is the hookah.",1,positive
From New Orleans and I love this place.  I haven't had anything bad yet. Pretty sure I ordered everything on the menu already.,1,positive
"Ok, who actually knows the south & barbecue?  I lived in Texas and can tell you honestly that this food is average at best.  Small portions, questionable sauces, high prices and by far, by FAR the slowest service I've had.  This is fried chicken and barbecue... No reason it should take 20+ minutes from your order to getting your food.  Save your TIME and money... Go elsewhere.",0,negative
"If you've ever been to New Orleans and have therefore been spoiled by actual cajun food, this place is a guaranteed disappointment. My $12 shrimp po'boy had maybe 10 shrimp on it, something that is supposed to be a staple of cajun cuisine. The couple of small pickles, half of a tomato slice and soggy lettuce given as dressings for the sandwich were an embarrassment. I'm not sure what flavor the chips were, because there was no flavor. I think I could have had better at Long John Silver's, and I hate Long John Silver's.",0,negative
Nice place to go eat if you want some southern food cooking. The chicken n dumplings were awesome. Yum to the squash casserole too! Mac n cheese is fab. People sitting around me were getting the cajun meatloaf and I may just try that the next time. \n\nOverall this is great place for southern comfort food!,1,positive

"Delightful interior with Mardi Gras/Bourbon Street murals and a giant jester statue inside.  Bar area merges into the restaurant area.  Upstairs seating overlooks downstairs like a outdoor balcony looking down on a street cafe.  Mojitos, chicken and sausage Jambalaya, and sweet potato fries are good, as are the po'boys.  The food is not that spicy; more on the bland side when one thinks of Cajun.",1,positive
"I love hot n juicy, I prefer it better than other crawlfish places! As soon as I walk in, I smell the amazing seafood served here and it leaves my mouth watering. I don't think the corn is fresh, and most of the time I come here the crawl fishes are frozen. \nI always order the one pound shrimp and it leaves me soooo full. Their rice goes great with the shrimp sauce! I love this place.",1,positive
A local favorite and the service is always great here. My favorite item on the menu is the Cajun chicken pasta and it never dissapoints. Big flavors and very filling. \nI also like the zingers which are probably the most popular from the big menu and you get to choose your sauce. It's a fun place to visit with very good food so you can't go wrong here.,1,positive
Fantastic chicken strips!  The Texas toast is good.  Fries could be crispier...  The Cane's sauce is GREAT.  I have only been at the drive thru for this location.,1,positive
"When it comes to food and service, Houstons is as consistent as it gets!! This Hillstone Group restaurant should teach Fox Restaurant Concepts a thing or two about this notion. \n\nAnywho.... I just wanted to let all Houstons soup fans know that they just changed the Sunday soup from Mexico City style to Mushroom Artichoke. =-0 I'm personally very disappointed with the removal of this favorite. However, I love mushrooms and artichokes. This soup is two thumbs up! \n\nBon Appetite!",1,positive
"A buddy of mine suggested we go here.... Thanks, Paul!\n\nThis is a tiny, bright yellow, dump of a building in a sketchy neighborhood and the menu is pretty narrowly focused on chicken.... but oh, man is the food good! The chicken is grilled over an open flame, you peel the meat off the bone yourself, roll it into a tortilla and cover it with the awesome sauce that they keep in squeeze bottles.... It's actually what people refer to when the say \""""Awesome Sauce\"""".... I'm sure of it.",1,positive
"I have fantasized about the idea of chicken and waffles for quite some time now, and Lo-Lo's Chicken and Waffles was all that I hoped for and more!  The chicken and waffles, cornbread, sweet potatoes, mac 'n cheese, grits and kool-aid were amazing! The restaurant itself is really cute too.  Very creative decor.  Such a fun, delicious dinner experience!",1,positive
"All I can say is YUMMM!!! My fiance and I are new to Charlotte so this was our first try at true Southern style soul food. Mert's was not a disappointment. The service was friendly. Very cozy southern feeling atmosphere. Very casual and chill and best of all, not overpriced! \n\nBiggest recommendations: The cornbread is to die for!!! OMG! The chicken is wonderful and the mac and cheese is soooo good! \n\nDefinitely worth checking out!",1,positive
"Good chicken, great flavors...it's what's to be expected at BWW. This location is good for a nice family getaway. Not as busy as other locations which is a plus and the staff is very helpful. Caribbean Jerk is a must, and the new flavor (Desert Heat) is a nice addition also. Keep up the good work!",1,positive
"Since my boyfriend and I both love biscuits and gravy we had to try this place out. Very friendly staff, cozy atmosphere and delicious food! We had the green chili and cheddar biscuits and gravy, scrambled eggs and pancakes. Wayyy too much food but it was all on special and all of it was delicious (especially the biscuits!) \n\nWe left here telling all of our friends and family about this place and couldn't wait to come back! If only it was a little closer to our house.... But it's worth the drive.",1,positive

"Everything I've tried at this place has ranged from excellent to phenomenal.  It's a very simple place with a limited menu of fried chicken, pork chops, catfish and other basic Southern food.  The catfish dinner is one huge(!) slab of fish with a really tasty batter.  The okra gumbo, available only on weekends, is excellent (try a couple dashes of hot sauce to liven it up).  On top of that the prices are cheap.  Service is friendly, and while sometimes they get really packed and it's a bit slower, it's never bad.",1,positive

Houston's is incredible!!!!!! Spinach artichoke dip so good the incredible filet mignon. Like butter and delicious. Service was excellent and the food was brought out with perfect timing. What a great place that I can't wait to visit again.,1,positive
"I tried Hubee D's for the first time last week. I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised. I had the buffalo chicken salad, it was very tasty. They served it with a piece of cornbread that was also tasty. The cornbread is so sweet it almost tasted like cake. My Hubby ordered the wings, he was satisfied. My son had the tender kids meal, he enjoyed it. The tenders were so fresh and juicy, and the fries were good and hot. I will definitely be back.",1,positive
Perfect chicken strips. Pretty good lemonade. Like the sauce not to bad. They do serve Texas toast. That's nice to have with your plate. Chicken is only thing on menu. Kids that love strips  will like this place. I like it.  Pretty simple place to eat if in mood for a chicken strip.,1,positive
"amazing New York chicken friend steak and chicken fried chicken. Huge portions, if you're thinking to spend your money here or at a crappy buffet, this place is definitely going to be worth your money. I was staying at the Golden Gate the first time I ate there, the convenience of it only added to the wonderful experience. Salivating at the thought of going back! I had the same experience at their location in San Diego as well.",1,positive
Love BC been going here for years! Pinenut crusted chicken is da bomb!!,1,positive
This place is the boom!!!  The best comfort food ever.  I have eaten everything on their menu and love it all.  Their fried chicken and waffles are great. Their sammies are yummy.\n\nWe also have TC's Cater our thanksgiving and Christmas dinners,1,positive
"I haven't even tried my food yet, Mrs Preacher is so nice and sweet the food could be terrible (not likely) and I'd still go back just to order a shake and see her smile. Brightened my day.",1,positive
"Memphis BBQ -Yuuuuuuuuuuuuum!!!\n\ncream corn, mac & cheese, BBQ Oooh MY!!!!",1,positive
"Being a Texas gal with a truly Southern food palette, Flavors sends you reminiscing about walks up and down Bourbon Street! The food is undeniably tasty and true to its name. My favorites are the red beans and rice, fried pickles, and the catfish! And the peach cobbler and beignets are worth the extra calories! The customer service is outstanding and its makes me smile when they remember my face and that I want sweet tea! Love to promote small places who arent chains! Worth the drive from anywhere!!!!!!!",1,positive
"Yummy! Great food, and one of the few places they remember your name. Terri is a terrific waitress. Savory or sweet- you can't go wrong.",1,positive
"A friend of mine and I meet every week or two for lunch, and this is where we always go.  If you like good home-style southern food at very reasonable prices, this is the place.  If they served nothing else but the fried squash, I would come just for that.  All the veggies are great!",1,positive
"Food Truck?? \n1st off its a trailer which in my case doesn't count as a traditional food truck.\nI don't recommend Coast to Coast simply because of the bad chicken I ate..\nThe sandwich was eh, & the chicken made me feel sick right after.\nSince its new I'm sure they are working some kinks out but I don't see myself eating here again..  Do not recommend.",0,negative
Nom nom nom across the board! Yeah if I could keep eating with no remorse this place would be it! For someone that has never been to New Orleans Lola's pulled me right in. Take note and order the Gouda grits! It was one of those food moments we ordered so much and proceeded to stuff our faces just because. You won't be disappointed and the service was great! Already planning my next LV trip and putting Lola's on the bucket list. Thanks to Wes and Syd for putting me on game to this joint!,1,positive
"This may be Southern Fusion, but not true Southern (try Dish for that!). GF has been here many times for lunch and loves it. First time for dinner:\n\nWe both got the meatloaf, veggies and mash taters - excellent. 2 meals, beer, and wine - $35.",1,positive
always take my family from out of town to raising canes cuz im not sure where else they have this business. love the toast. chicken is obviously tasty.lol everyone needs to give this a try if they never had it before,1,positive
"We came to Houston's to have their secret chicken tender appetizer, and it did not disappoint. Another excellent, melt in your mouth white breast meat tender coated in tempura batter, with the same awesome horseradish infused honey mustard sauce and bbq sauce, with shoestring fries included. And the wait staff were all very attractive. Wow!",1,positive
"Hands down the best Cajun food in the Midwest.  Gumbo, jambalaya, cornbread all excellent.",1,positive
"Not sure why everyone is crazy about this place. chicken fingers tasted ordinary for me, sauce is forgettable, fries are soggy, and coleslaw is like the one in the supermarket. the only one i liked is the toasted bread. \nThough the store and location is great and neat.",0,negative
"For what it is and the price, out of the Low Country Charleston we have a wing place with low country inspired sauces.  Everything has been delicious and well put together !! Love it",1,positive
"I got around to driving here for lunch one day and wow I could smell the place before I could see it. I don't have much fried chicken experience but their chicken is moist, tender, and crisp on the outside. Knowing it's probably a heart attack in a box makes it even more delicious! Sweet tea is quite a foreign concept to me coming from out west, but after one sip I had to buy another cup. I wish there was some form of seating available though, maybe a couple chairs outside or something at least?",1,positive

The yams are going to make me come back again and again. The fried chicken is really good as well. A little surprised that I couldn't find an on line menu but ordering over the phone was easy enough. Our portions were pretty descent sized but could have been a little larger compared to other soul food restaurants we have tried. We'll go back but I'll fore go the somewhat tasteless mac and cheese next time and try another side.,1,positive
"Fast fast fast diner food.   Delicious Chicken Pot Pie!  Seriously, we went for lunch and i SWEAR the waitress took our order, walked back to the kitchen and returned with our food.   Southern Home cooking Fast.",1,positive
"Stopped to check this place out today and was quite pleased! Simple menu, easy to choose from. Rotisserie chicken with sides, beer and wine. Great location for ASU. Had a really good BBQ chicken sandwich!",1,positive
Great unpretentious food. Bobby flay is the man!,1,positive
"I can't believe no one here has mentioned the shrimp and grits...they are the best I've had anywhere...and I'm a foodie! I'm afraid to try shrimp and grits anywhere else because I know I'll be disappointed, and so far I've been right. My son won't visit me from NJ without going for shrimp and grits. AWESOME! Also their vegetables are wonderful!",1,positive
"If you do not care how clogged your arteries get and have Ok blood sugar then pig out....I would not call this a good Cajun restaurant but it is on the cusp of Cajun.  It is not expensive and a real Cajun would cost more....but health wise....don't do this too often....it is tasty and if you really need a guilt trip...this place will do it for you...kill yourself but not your children, please.",1,positive
"My first time trying Raising Cane's.  I got the box, and I liked the chicken fingers, the dipping sauce and the coleslaw.  I am not a big fan of Texas toast in general so I can't gauge how good it was. I am not a big fan of their fries.  Overall, I like it.",1,positive
I would come back to this place just for the cornbread.  I had a mac and cheese type dish that was pretty good.  The service was good.  I came during lunch and they served us pretty quickly.,1,positive
The Tin Kitchen is definitely one of the best food trucks I've been to. Had a shrimp and grits cake entree and overall it was a really good dish. This truck always has a long line but the food is well worth the wait.,1,positive
"Frankly I was just disappointed with Baton Rouge. \n\nIn sequence:\n- the Manhattan I ordered was watery and weak\n- the spinach dip was not cooked thoroughly and when it was taken back, they returned it after only reheating it in the microwave\n- the staff was cool but not overwhelming, especially with several occasions to provide good customer service\n- the filet was good, but not prime quality\n\nFor those south of the border, think Hillstone's/Houston's but with lower quality results.",0,negative
Great tasty Chicago food.  Love the dressing for the fries,1,positive
"Classic eastern NC BBQ done right! The best in town no doubt. Great southern hospitality with hush puppies, slaw, sweet tea and banana pudding.  Doesn't get any better. \nIf you are looking for a hip and trendy decor go to some hip and trendy place. If you are looking for down home southern goodness the way it has been done for 50 years and the best in town come to Bill Spoon's.  Great man, great legacy, great food.",1,positive
"Great place for chicken. I come here about 3 times a month, Love the corn and black bean sides",1,positive
"It's hard to believe your eating fast food, seriously, the first time I came here I was impressed. The chicken is not greasy, cooked just right, and my favorite part is the JUICY TENDERNESS- OOOHHH SOOOO TENDER. LOVE it. And thats not the only thing I love- HELLO?! Texas Toast! and the house sauce. The menu is super simple and everything is good so you cant go wrong :)",1,positive
Classic feeling southern food. I enjoyed my chicken and dumplings more than most places.... take that Cracker Barrel!,1,positive
The Tin Kitchen is definitely one of the best food trucks I've been to. Had a shrimp and grits cake entree and overall it was a really good dish. This truck always has a long line but the food is well worth the wait.,1,positive
"I had heard a lot about how great the food was at Lo-Lo's downtown location, so was excited to try when I saw they opened a place in Scottsdale. It is by far the best fried chicken I have ever had! The idea of waffels and chicken sounded weird to me, but after trying it~ Im hooked. This place is by far some of the best \""""comfort\"""" food I have ever had. A must try... & my kids love the Kool Aide :)",1,positive
"Went here a couple times: liked the homemade lemonade, chicken (the best fried chicken i've eaten in Az), catfish (never had eaten catfish this good anywhere), waffles (remind me of waffle house), corn bread, and mac n cheese. Didn't like the gizzards and gravy, but would go back to get the gizzards minus the gravy. Did I mention I am a fat fuck, oh yeah!",1,positive
"Food here is excellent, my favorite is the shrimp po boy. If you like good southern food, this is the place to go! I have eaten here many times over the last few years, and have NO complaints!!!",1,positive
"Extremely tasty food.  I inhaled my plate of salmon cakes, mac and cheese and mashed potatoes.  The cornbread was tasty and buttery.  The service was fast and friendly, the sweet tea was syrupy sweet and the interior is very entertaining.\nMy sister enjoyed a dessert - was it sweet potato cake?  Something that seemed a bit odd to me.\nAs far as uptown southern goes, I'd say Mert's is your spot for casual, friendly, quick but still very tasty - a nice place to hang out with friends.  King's is better for dressy and classy.",1,positive
Fantastic chicken strips!  The Texas toast is good.  Fries could be crispier...  The Cane's sauce is GREAT.  I have only been at the drive thru for this location.,1,positive
I don't go to Dish for the culinary experience.  I do love the laid-back vibe with some good southern hangover/late night grub.  I like to order a half grilled cheese sandwish with a cup of tomato bisque.  I love that you get a deviled egg as a side to many dishes.  Nice touch.  My favorite is the black bean and rice burrito.  Cool tunes in the juke box.  Just a good local spot w/o the frills.,1,positive
"I had heard all of the hype, but had never been. Now I can't wait to go back. The grits are the best around. Thick, hearty and full of flavor. My only regret was not getting them smothered with bacon and cheese. I would rate the chicken fried steak in the top three valley wide. Tender with a tasty breading and enough country gravy to go around. The eggs were just okay, as was the coffee. The staff was friendly and the place was spotless. Definitely a good spot for breakfast with a return trip in the near future.",1,positive
"After seeing reviews and pictures from my fellow Charlotteans et al about the chicken and waffles, I had to come try them.\nThe waffle was good.  The chicken wings were large and seasoned well. \n\nGood to know this place is open 24/7 in case I need to visit at anytime during my next sojourn to CharMeck!",1,positive
"Never eaten at any of TK's Napa places. But can the man make the ultimate remoulade or what?  My pork short ribs were perfect.  There's no other word except perfect.  Such simple dishes, such perfection.  The sommelier was awesome. Dessert was ...eh.",1,positive
"Since my boyfriend and I both love biscuits and gravy we had to try this place out. Very friendly staff, cozy atmosphere and delicious food! We had the green chili and cheddar biscuits and gravy, scrambled eggs and pancakes. Wayyy too much food but it was all on special and all of it was delicious (especially the biscuits!) \n\nWe left here telling all of our friends and family about this place and couldn't wait to come back! If only it was a little closer to our house.... But it's worth the drive.",1,positive
"The grits are worth the trip. Everything else is quality, but the grits are the real treat. We usually go there every other Sunday morning.",1,positive
"I am a huge fan of biscuits. I eat here at least twice a month on average and have yet to be disappointed in any of the dishes i have tried. This mom and pop features flavorful country cooking at its best, and a friendly staff who take the time to get to know their customers. This place has a very local community feel. You can never go wrong with the country fried steak here, but my surprise favorite dish here is the smoked jalapeno Alfredo pasta, give it a try.",1,positive
Love BC been going here for years! Pinenut crusted chicken is da bomb!!,1,positive
"Great comfort food. I recommend the country style chicken. You can't go wrong with the sides. I like their fried okra, mac n cheese and country style green beans. And don't forget to wash it down with sweet tea. Melany our waitress was the best. Friendly, personable, and knew just when we needed something. (Refills, extra napkins, to go boxes). Also love the country store. They have great unique gift ideas and fun candy and toys for the kids.",1,positive
"They do chicken and tri tip. Chicken is hella dry and salty, but the tri tip is bomb!",1,positive
"While out and about, my wife and I came across this restaurant. Similar to a Perkins, the waitstaff was quite friendly. On this occasion, we tried: \n\nDeep fried catfish w/ff & sweet corn\nChopped BBQ pork w/fried okra & collard greens\n\nDefinitely a nice touch to Southern cuisine. Next time we're int he area, we'll search for this place again.",1,positive
"This is one of those places you can go at lunch time and run into everyone from your local car detailer to power-brokers like the former CEO of NationsBank (now Bank of America).  The food is absolutely delish, but be warned - your clothes and hair will smell of southern-fried goodness when you leave. If you are craving good ole soul food - aka southern \""""comfort foods\"""" this place is a must-try!",1,positive
"This is the best restaurant in the state . . . maybe the world.\n\nGet the Swate Tay (sweet tea) and the \""""Lolos\"""" (i think it's #3). The fried catfish is great too. Everything is great. They play gospel music on Sundays yayyuhhh",1,positive
This place is great. It looks small on the outside but it's gigantic on the inside. Very quaint and reminiscent of an abode in the French quarter. I had the popcorn crawfish and the red beans and rice here. Both dishes were awesome. The pop corn crawfish was meaty and had a slight hint of spice to it not salty or anything. Let's not talk about the sweet tea. That was just marvelous. Not too sweet. It was just right.,1,positive
"Love Raising Cane's. I ordered the Box and ate it all. Super delicious chicken and Texas toast. The fries are ehhh but everything else, including the people that work here, is good. My only complaint is the small parking lot. It gets pretty busy here sometimes and it's hard to find a spot.",1,positive
"Delightful interior with Mardi Gras/Bourbon Street murals and a giant jester statue inside.  Bar area merges into the restaurant area.  Upstairs seating overlooks downstairs like a outdoor balcony looking down on a street cafe.  Mojitos, chicken and sausage Jambalaya, and sweet potato fries are good, as are the po'boys.  The food is not that spicy; more on the bland side when one thinks of Cajun.",1,positive
"I just had the Catfish Po' Boy and it was to die for, if I come across the food truck again I will order it again, and again",1,positive
"I don't care if you're a visitor....native...your mamas mama made the best fried chicken and waffles....just come here. Roscoes has nothing on this place. Great good and selection, they have more than just chicken and waffles. Lucas was our server tonight, and he was great.",1,positive
"This place is as tasty as cotton candy, as authentic as its culture and the food is beyond delicious. There is no place like it West of Missicippi river? Is that how you spell Missiccipi? Server has good attitude. I order S1 it was great. We were in and out in less than 35mn on our way back to LA.",1,positive
Can't believe it took me 2 years to try this restaurant. Went last night and had the best food and service. Loved the homemade biscuits with cinnamon butter. I had the tri tip sandwich and it was delicious. Husband had the brisket which was also good. Can't go wrong with a place that serves their beverages in a mason jar - the strawberry lemonade hit the spot.,1,positive
"This place is perfection! After going a few times with my boyfriend, I can see how one could crave some chicken and waffles on a Sunday morning.  Don't sleep in too late though because you will wait if you hit the church crowd.  Don't skip the grits!",1,positive
"I ordered the Cajun Combination and it was AWESOME. If your close by you have to check this place out, if your not close by you need to make the time to go here!",1,positive
"one of the best in town..I like the steam chicken and the salt and pepper crab,  and the deep fried chicken is moist and tasty..the melon juice is fresh too..must try.......highly recommend",1,positive
Great chicken fried steak! They get the hash browns perfect! Great prices!,1,positive
Whenever we have guests from out of town we always get them to try the friend chicken experience of Bojangles and more importantly.... Prices Chicken Coop.\n\nWhen I first heard about this place from my dad it was hard for me to grasp the concept.... you just have to try the chicken. It's not dine in... just take out but the line is out the door for a reason.\n\nI am not a liver person.... but I hear their fried liver is the best. I'm just in it for the chicken. It's unique and tasty.,1,positive
Love the chicken fried steak.,1,positive
I enjoyer both their Chicago style and their thin... Sauce is just the right spices.. Good stuff,1,positive
"A buddy of mine suggested we go here.... Thanks, Paul!\n\nThis is a tiny, bright yellow, dump of a building in a sketchy neighborhood and the menu is pretty narrowly focused on chicken.... but oh, man is the food good! The chicken is grilled over an open flame, you peel the meat off the bone yourself, roll it into a tortilla and cover it with the awesome sauce that they keep in squeeze bottles.... It's actually what people refer to when the say \""""Awesome Sauce\"""".... I'm sure of it.",1,positive
"Visiting NC from AZ and was very disappointed in food - until I tried Nana's!  I had a small plate of smothered fried chicken,great Mac n cheese, yams.  All was flavorful and homecooked. I am on my way to the airport stuffed. Glad I tried one more place. :)",1,positive
I'm going to have to say this is one of my favorite places to eat in the burgh. I am going to give it a 5 star chitty chitty bang bang rating. I had the seafood combo and it was delecticable. The chicken soup was out of this world. Service was quick and friendly. It definitely hit the spot on all notes. I will most certainly return.,1,positive

Nice place to go eat if you want some southern food cooking. The chicken n dumplings were awesome. Yum to the squash casserole too! Mac n cheese is fab. People sitting around me were getting the cajun meatloaf and I may just try that the next time. \n\nOverall this is great place for southern comfort food!,1,positive
"So Cane's does have the best fingers I have had so far.  This location is close to home and the staff are ok, they are not the friendliest but I am not there to make friends, but to get some good food. \n\nLast night the oil smelled like it was time to change it but it did not leave an after taste which was good.\n\nIt is food I should not eat often but it really fills a void when hungry late at night and now I found out they have a Canes club card, oh yes.\n\nA good place to grab some quick food that will not disappoint.",1,positive
"Having never been east of Utah, I can't speak to how authentic Lola's is. I can say that what we had was delicious and we will become regulars. I had Jambalaya that was outstanding. My significant other had a smoked ham sandwich that was superb.",1,positive
"Loved this place.  It was great to find this place off the strip.  Small not fancy place but everything about it is big.  Big flavors and big personality (our server was funny and just awesome).  The food was really good.  Try the broiled oysters.  My god, I just wanted to eat more and more. the entrees were good depending on what you ordered good beer and the desserts were awesome. Get the sweet potato pie.  This place is very casual.  Go if you want a no fuss restaurant with good Cajun food and great service.",1,positive
Coleslaw is amazing. Prices are great,1,positive
"I actually have seen this truck before but last night finally tried something from them. It was the Pork Belly Sliders with Apple slaw and it was Awesome, try them if you see them around!",1,positive
"Looking for Cajun? Look no further. My favorites are the etufee and gumbo. I stopped in on a Friday night and had the pork chop special, it had to be the biggest and most tender chop I've had! For those of you looking for a classic dirty rice they took me back to a LA coonass swap party. The live guitar sole was a great addition for back ground music.",1,positive
"My dad and I make it to Texas Roadhouse at least once a month just to eat their fresh rolls with cinnamon butter.  Everyone is on a budget these days and the food is a super bargain!  I've had the ribs, steak, and prime rib and they have all tasted great.  I know it's a chain restaurant and all, but the food and prices make it worthy of a visit.",1,positive
With a name like chicken king I thought they would only have fried chicken.  I got a great Greek salad when they changed the sign and was pleasantly surprised.  It is much closer than showmars with a similar menu.  I will be back,1,positive
"Popeyes fried chicken is one of the best. I love how crispy the skin gets as soon as it is scooped out of the fryer. Right amount of heat and spices. The mild flavor is a bit boring. I always go for the leg and thigh special for 99 cents. Awesome deal! Do not forget the red beans and rice, mashed with gravy and buttery biscuits. Sometimes the sides cost more than the chicken. Make sure you take your daily dose of cholesterol pills (statins). Welcome, you are in deep fried heaven.",1,positive

Definitely a great choice for some good southern food that isn't too expensive.  I use to frequent this restaurant almost weekly before relocating to Arizona.  I must say it's one of the main things I miss about living in Charlotte.  Have yet to find a place like it (especially in Arizona),1,positive
"Great soul food joint that really knows what Southern Food is all about. SWEET Tea (yes, that sweet), real Texas Pete hot sauce on the table, great grits, bacon, eggs and biscuits, Also fantastic chicken and waffles (OK, waffles are eggos out of the freezor case, but the bird is dead on). I am from NC and have been all over the South eating bird, OK? I KNOW bird. This is GOOD bird - crisp, almost greaseless, and HOT outta the fryer. Best locals soul food joint in LV - trust me.",1,positive

"Ive been to many Texas Road houses across the country but this one was very dissapointing. The food was cooked sloppily, my steak was supposed to be medium rare but it was overdone and chewy and grisly, my side of rice was overcooked and tasted like mush. The waitress forgot everything we would ask for and had to come back several times for something as simple as steak sauce. \n\nThe only redeeming factor is the bread was always delicious and amazing as usual.",0,negative
"For a resturant that is right on the strip, this place was NO DICE. Service was subpar, the servers seemed rushed and flustered at all times and food was... well the same as the rest so I guess that's a plus.",0,negative
"Blech, do yourself a favor and go to ANY of the buffets on the Strip and you'll get a better bang for your buck. Not worth it.",0,negative
"Best buffet on the strip. Hands down. Server was very friendly and attentive.  The food was great, definitely coming back here",1,positive
What a yummy lunch just off the strip. But if you aren't very hungry you must stop in to the ladies restroom just for the luxury of it.,1,positive
Very fun casual setting with an outdoor patio right on the strip great for people watching... I have not tried their food but this is a must stop to try their famous frozen hot chocolate!  It's a nice sweet treat that comes in multiple flavors (some even with alcohol) to help beat the Vegas summer heat,1,positive
"I love the open feeling and the view of the strip is amazing. The staff is always friendly and do not miss the opportunity to have the guacamole made fresh at your table.\nWhenever I have out-of-town friends visit, this is on my to-do-list.\n\nParking lot is SMALL. If you do not hit it right, you have to park across the street, which is not safe, since it is on a hill.\n\nThe food is good and plentiful. Wait staff is attentive.",1,positive
Don't do it... Save you're money for the M resort Studio B buffet it might be off the strip and 15mins away but its worth it. Spice Market was mediocre and costly for absolutely no selection. I should of read the reviews before going there...Shame on me!!,0,negative
"Good food, good service and a great view of the Strip. \n\nWe will return next time we have a hankering for authentic Mexican food.",1,positive
"Nothing fancy or pretentious, which is exactly what they seem to want. Just good food, reasonably priced, and friendly attentive service. If you're looking for more then that, go to the Strip",1,positive
"Absolutely AMAZING. Definitely worth leaving the strip for! Go for the scallops, duck, yellowtail carpaccio, and grilled rice balls. Don't forget the fluffy cheesecake!",1,positive
"This place is wonderful! Who doesn't love it? The crepe pancakes are outstanding. The home fries, soft and buttery. The Oakland location was somewhat recently remodeled to be bright and inviting. The Strip location has a couple unique and well regarded items such as the Tex Mex Omelette and pulled pork sandwich.",1,positive
So yummy! Great staff and awesome authentic mexican food! It's off the strip and well worth the drive.,1,positive
"As good as it gets on the strip.  The food, as you would expect, very solid. Lobster tacos were the best ever.  Steak cooked to perfection.  The atmosphere is top notch as well and the staff treat you like royalty.  It can be tough to get a reservation so be sure to book in advance of your trip.",1,positive
"Avoid this place for everything other than the steakhouse.\n\nYes, it's a good deal for the price, but it stinks, it's dirty, it's on the end of the strip, and it stinks.  It really, really stinks--like smoke and ammonia and rotting food.",0,negative
"It is a diner in the Strip.  Staff is friendly, food is good.    They require a $9.00 minimum order for credit/debit cards.  Most menu items are in the $7 range.",1,positive
"Order the Big Kabluna,  Jumbo Combo and Texan.  Best food and atmosphere on the strip.",1,positive
Great breakfast and a perfect view of the Strip.  Get there early or make reservations to get a nice spot outside.,1,positive
"It's my go to place for some quick food on the strip after a night out. I've eaten here sober, during the day too. My favorite sandwich is the Original 1762. It's a simple sandwich that does the job. Toasted bread, roast beef, melted cheddar, and horseradish sauce makes me a pretty happy person. It's not the best sandwich I've ever eaten. But for it's location on the strip, being open 24 hours, and the price for a pretty decent sandwich, I'm a fan.",1,positive
"My favorite bar in the Strip District.  Timeless classic that never goes out of style.  They had a remodeled a few years ago, which opened the front of the restaraunt and they they've created a patio of sorts that is perfect for outside dining when the sun decides to shine.  Excellent seafood options, and you'll never go wrong with the lobster rolls.  The hot lobster roll is served on buttery Mancini roll and melts in your mouth.",1,positive
This place it just O.K.  There was a wait to get in and when we got seated we got the high bar stool chairs and after an hour my feet fell asleep.  \n\nThe service was TERRIBLE.  The waitress was difficult to find.  My boyfriend never had his drink refilled.  The food was below average but the prices were NOT.  I had a super huge Margarita that was great though and that was the only redeeming thing about the place.  Still it has a good location on the strip...but if you are looking for quality food...keep walking.,0,negative
"This is a little bit off the strip, but the view is so nice, and the price is low! Also, the Champagne brunch is good!",1,positive
"ok. im not one to get on here and completly put a company down, but this place was a disappointment. out of all of the places on the strip we decided to meet and eat here. i give 2 stars for the scenery and the rock n roll, but the rest was a disappointment. The service was not great, and the food seemed like something you would order in a diner. adult beverages were ok, but the overall experiences didnt rock it!  Sorry hard rock, but there is much better right out of your front door on the veas strip!",0,negative
"Really the only reason to eat here is because you're starving and it'll take 20 minutes plus to walk across the ginormous MGM grand to cheaper and tastier food options.. Other than that my \""""gourmet\"""" sandwich tasted pretty awful and cost me a near fortune. Strip dining can be tough, but you'd be better off at Mickey D's...",0,negative
"The best lunch on the strip... great eats, reasonable prices and a fantastic atmosphere*** back for a third year in a row, still the best!",1,positive
"Bill's is a great place to come and crash if you're shell-shocked by the prices on the Strip.  I walked in with three other friends after we ran from Caesar's high table minimums and beer prices.  $8 for two pitchers of beer?  $1 margaritas?  $5 table minimums?  Lounge singers?  Old people dancing?  I'm sold, baby.\n\nIn terms of decor, quality of the bands, friendliness of the dealers, etc.. you'll definitely get exactly what you pay for.  But at least you aren't paying a lot.",1,positive
"Cheap, yum and delicious varities tacos!\nI love the spicy pork where they cut from the freshly roasted rack!\neasy access location by bus, abit away from the strip but if u stay at wynn or encore it's totally walkable.",1,positive
"I think this is the best restaurant on the strip.  Fish is awesome and the steaks are just as good.  Service is outstanding also.  It costs a mint, but it may actually be worth the money.  I would not recomend the seafood tower unless that is your entree.  It is big and the portions on the regular entrees are generous.",1,positive
We have been coming here for a few years now. The drinks are awesome. This time we are lunch and were not disappointed. The food was fresh and service was genuine and attentive. The place is outfitted with incredible design elements. It's a great option for dining on the strip without breaking the bank.,1,positive
This place was a reasonable walk from Bally's (so centrally located on the strip). Friendly and fun staff. Cocktails a bit on the pricey side but the food was pretty good and delivered fast for how busy it was. Good place if you're out for a walk and need a good snack.,1,positive
"Do your self a solid and skip the Strip. This is far more affordable, fun and unique. I love it.",1,positive
"I would give this restaurant 0 stars if I could.  The food was lousy, the drinks were expensive, and the service was awful.\n\nI complained to the manager about my experience and he told that if I didn't like it, there were plenty of other bars in The Strip District.\n\nPlease, please, please go somewhere else.",0,negative
A nice vacation destination. It's the New Year and I feel lucky for this place. It opens late especially around the 4 am hours. Ate the #13 pho and was completely satisfied. Nothing like hot noodle soup (with some meat if course) after walking around 30 degree weather in the desert. \n\nWorth the drive for people wanting better Asian food selection away from the strip.,1,positive
Food is good as always. Cool design outside and single golden arches make this a cool spot to hit up after the club or gambling on the strip.,1,positive
"Amazing! The food and customer service is wonderful! My friends and I ordered pancakes, French toast, eggs, and home potatoes. The bacon was the best. It's about a ten minute drive from the strip. Very small, but wait is only about ten minutes! Definitely go! All the staff care! (:",1,positive
"My buddies and I were starving after watching the Ohio State/Northwestern.  Someone in our group suggested this place.  I had misgivings about a possible tourist trap right on the strip.  I was wrong.  We had a very good server.   We had some pretty good chicken wings.  I had the BBQ brisket sandwich.  Maybe I was hungry, it did turn  out to be a terrific sandwich.",1,positive
"Best cheap eats on this part of the strip.  Try \""""The Original\"""", you won't regret it!\nG",1,positive
"Now my go-to place in the land of stripmalls.\n\nBe careful, they bring the spicy if you ask for it.",1,positive
**** Good if  late night and you're high/drunk/under the influence **** \n\nThe Pho is overpriced and salty.  I guess they can afford to do so since it's close to the strip.  Just drive down the street to Pho So 1.\n\nThe only reason why I like this place is to give my tourist friends a laugh when they see the sign.\n\nMy 12 year old side wants to call them on speed dial so I can hear them answer.,0,negative
It's exactly the same as the other one down the street. Maybe a little smaller. Just as delicious. It can get quite busy sometimes and may be hard to flag a server down. But totally worth a little side trip from the strip just for dinner.,1,positive
Food was excellent. Fresh. Great service. Nice to see some awesome food on our stay. A little far from the strip but was worth the taxi ride. \n\nThey have some great sauces to mix the perfect ingredients for dipping your meat.,1,positive
"To be honest, the food was not so good.  The service was even worse.  It took 10 minutes for a waiter to come to our table after we sat down.  Great view of the strip.",0,negative
"Great \""""after the club\"""" food.  After drinking and partying on the strip, head over to Ellis island for their 4.99 steak and eggs graveyard special.  It ain't no ruth's chris steakhouse but not bad for $4.99.  Actually not bad for $7.99 either. *4.99 steak and eggs is only available after 11 pm and is not on the menu",1,positive
Cheap eats just minutes from the strip. :),1,positive
"pizza's good.  price is actually not too bad for a slice...when you factor in it's on the STRIP, in the COSMO.  drinks kinda pricey - but like I said...you're in the COSMO.  Pretty long line, I mean i'm sure it's gets enough action from Marquee.  Didnt really think about that, until we saw all the drunk partyers from the dayclub",1,positive
"I like the trendy low key feel of this place. And the few isn't bad either of the Palazzo and T.I\n\nPhilly cheesesteaks in a potsticker? Unique. Girls ask for the cotton candy kiss.\nThis place gets 5 stars for the uniquenss of the menu and drinks. It's hard to stand out in the restaurants on the strip but this place does a fantastic job of it. Also I tried their duck and was great. \nOh yeah You get a free pretzel, eh, but a nice place overall.",1,positive
"\""""We dine well here in Camelot, we eat ham and jam and Spam a lot.\"""" Monty Python and the Holy Grail\n\nI took a group of thirty here and the manager at the front did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to help accommodate us. Food is \""""meh\"""" at best, service is horrible. There are too many other great buffets on the strip to come back here for a mediocre ham and jam and Spam experience.",0,negative
Hard choosing a place to eat when you're on the strip with young kids. You can't go wrong with pizza (though not my personal first choice.) Was walking through Caesars and saw DiFara. Ordered a whole meat pizza for the family. Honestly the BEST food court or restaurant quality pizza I've tasted. Worth a try whether you are looking for something fast or just plain delicious pizza!,1,positive
"Excellent food for an excellent price. First trip and first Yelp, but highly impressed. Drinks are priced to recupe for the food, but definitely give it a shot.  If you see an open seat, you're lucky - take it. Four stars for great food but slightly overpriced drinks off of the strip.",1,positive
Great for breakfast - perfect escape from overpriced Strip food - just 5-10 minutes away from the strip.,1,positive
"The buffet was ok for $11, but it was not worth the drive from the strip.  Definitely a spot for locals and not snobby tourists like me.",0,negative
"Great place to dine if you somehow end up drinking and are hungry after a night of dancing. The food was delicious and the service was great. My only complaint was that the tables were so close together that I felt I was also dining with the people next to me. Yes it is a little pricier but you are dining on the strip in the cosmo, you won't be finding a dollar menu here. Highly recommend if youre in the area and want the most amazing breakfast burrito.",1,positive

"Blech, do yourself a favor and go to ANY of the buffets on the Strip and you'll get a better bang for your buck. Not worth it.",0,negative
"Only come here for happy hour drinks.  All of the food we had was ridiculously salty.  The carnitas were so salty we could not finish them, which was unfortunate considering the price.  I've had much better Mexican food for half the price back in San Francisco.  Ignoring the food, the happy hour drinks were actually quite good and one of the better deals you'll find on The Strip.",0,negative
"Best restaurant I have ever eaten at.  Not the best location, but inside is great.  Service is wonderful.  The food is better than anything I have had on the strip.",1,positive
"This restaurant is awesome. My girlfriends and I went to have brunch here after a long night out of partying. BEST hangover food ever. Not only are the portions huge, they are delicious! The presentation of the food is also very nice. Almost all entrees have chocolate. I ordered the lazy breakfast and loved it. Customer services is great, prices are decent for a restaurant on The Strip, and the restaurant environment is nice.\n\n2 thumbs up! Next time I need to leave room for dessert!",1,positive
"Not for the faint of heart (or wallet)!\n\nThe food here is very good. Interesting selection of fresh fish, giant prawns and the octopus starter is great. We were given a prime table with a view of the Strip and attentive service. Be warned, however, that the prices are extortionate! Dinner for 4 with a bottle of wine, whole fish ($270) and four giant prawns ($117), two appetizers, two sides and two desserts plus coffee totaled $850. That's approximately double what I'd expected to pay when I made the reservation.",1,positive
"Come here at an odd time because it's always packed and it's hard to find a parking spot. It's a surprise to me that this place doesn't have at least 4 stars. You get a nice view of the strip and the food is fantastic. The staff don't seem frantic or annoyed even if they get so busy. They have so many loyal customers including myself. It can get pretty loud especially if there's anybody celebrating their birthday. So, if you're the grumpy kind or having a migraine headache, this is not the place for you.",1,positive
"Cute little cafe with a nice view of the strip. Great if you enjoy watching people pass by a classy establishment drunk as a skunk wielding the yard-long margarita. \n\nThe roast chicken wrap was pretty much the best wrap I've had ever. Perfect proportions of everything-it was simply amazing. The service was great and we got free popovers with strawberry butter so everyone wins.\n\nOnly complaint I had was the drink I ordered from the bar was pretty watered down, but other than, great experience!",1,positive

"Just was walking by when looking for dinner and this restaurant had an appealing setting. The waitstaff was ok, nothing special. Best part of the whole meal was the complimentary bread basket. The penne a la vodka lacked taste and the margarita pizza was nothing special. Definitely overpriced for the quality of the food. Disappointed overall, much better options on the strip.",0,negative
Horrible place. We purchased a groupn to use and they would not accept it. Their food was average at best and their service was below average. They would not even apologize about the groupon. Their are much better places to eat closer to the strip.,0,negative
"Mon Ami Gabi is one of my favorites on the strip. It has a true parisian feel, and a very professional staff. Their food is great, and at good value on the strip, and an extensive wine list. The waiters know the wine as well, so don't be afraid to ask for recomendations. \n\nBe sure to make a reservation if you're going for brunch/lunch on the weekend, it's a popular spot.",1,positive
"This is my favorite place to eat lunch in the strip...  Try to go about once a week.  Friendly staff and great food, fast.",1,positive
Food was excellent. Fresh. Great service. Nice to see some awesome food on our stay. A little far from the strip but was worth the taxi ride. \n\nThey have some great sauces to mix the perfect ingredients for dipping your meat.,1,positive
"Cheap, incredibly tasty, lunch option.\nu won't find stuff this cheap on the strip.. \nfrom the PH poker room you can order from here and have it delivered. but note: they wont' take poker chips, u have to use cash.\n\ni had the italian sandwich.. it's simple but it's delicioius..\n\nthe only problem - i walked by there at least 10 times since i stayed at PH this time. i would say minimum 15-20 ppl waiting in line.. maximum 40 or so ppl in line. which is just NUTS.",1,positive
"Best buffet on the strip. Hands down. Server was very friendly and attentive.  The food was great, definitely coming back here",1,positive
"I was soo hyped up to go to this place. I remember I ordered their famous frozen hot chocolate. Basically, it is a chocolate shake with a fancy name. Fancy decor but service was not good.  Amazing location for the tourists but for the locals, it's quite of a hike to get there if we have to park somewhere. Go again? Only for the strip watching.",0,negative
"So many great buffets and restaurants on the strip, don't waste your time with this one.  Variety is good, but quality is not.  Wouldn't go back.",0,negative
"These guys are crankin' amazing sandwiches out at all hours of the night. Probably the best cheap quick meal you can find at 4am on the strip. Definitely check it out if you're anywhere near the PH and looking for a cheap bite. The lines can get long, especially around the lunch hours. \n\nStrong advocate of the Chipotle Chicken, don't forget to ask for banana peppers. They're so good, I strongly considered smuggling a few of these badboys back home in my duffle.",1,positive
"This is an awesome deal, you can eat at 6 different casinos on the strip!!! Everything was great, we got it about 1 in the afternoon and had lunch, dinner and breakfast then lunch as our last meal. GREAT DEAL!!!! We actually met people that were on a mission to eat at all 6 locations before their 24 hours were up. Fight on!!",1,positive
Came on a Friday mid-day. We were seated right away and the server gave us plenty of time to decide.\n\n\nThe pre-meal bread was very yummy. The menu is very extensive and there was so much to choose from. My friend and I settled with the Asian Nachos.. Very yummy! Definitely good to split. They were very rich.\n\nI would come back here. Decent prices for the strip and something for everyone.,1,positive
"I came here after work with a coworker; we had to wait about ten minutes for a table, which was better than I'd expected. The service was great, the food was so unbelievably reasonably priced for the strip (we spent $62 total and we ordered 1 appetizer, 2 entrees, and 2 desserts). The food was delicious as well; try the lettuce wraps!!",1,positive
"Good food, not to far from strip. And cheaper then most places around. Food is a little different then what I'm use to in Vancouver which is also cheaper. Place looks a bit sketchy, but who cares, food is good!",1,positive
"If you like chicken and house music, you'll love this place.  I actually liked the food, but whoever is selecting the music over there apparently spends his/her evenings at every club on the Strip and just can't get enough.  I got stressed while trying enjoy my food and had to leave.  If they change the music, I give this place 4 stars.",0,negative
"This is a favorite locals spot with great service. The desserts are incredible and worth the trip by itself. It has a good vibe with huge comfortable chairs, tons of TV's for the game, and very good bartenders.  This is our favorite spot off the strip.",1,positive
"I've been to the NY establishment where the wait is 4 hours. I had to try the one here since they just opened it. They are known for their famous frozen hot chocolate. They even have a statue of it. The food is pretty good and big portions. The salads are huge and the BLT is superb. I loooove coming here because it is such a cute, girly establishment. My bf does not like it but I would come here for a cute lunch with girlfriends. On a nice day it's great to sit outside with a view of the strip.",1,positive
"This was the second time that my wife and i had eaten there. The word AMAZING sums it up. We arrived right when the doors opened for dinner and where seated right away. The food was amazing and not horribly priced, especially when you look at the fact that you basically get 2 meals out of one meal. Really good food and great wait staff. One of our favorites and it is worth the trek off the strip if you are a visitor",1,positive
"I've always liked the atmosphere at the Cafe. It's fun to watch the music videos and sing along. This HR Cafe is usually pretty slow when I've gone, ever since they opened a second one on the strip. So if you don't want to deal with big crowds, I'd visit this location instead of the strip location. Service is and has always been fast and the staff is very friendly. The food is good, same as the other HR Caf\u00e9s it's pretty standardized across the chain. The cocktails are good, averagely priced for the strip.",1,positive
"Great breakfast food at a reasonable price... Try the strawberry stuffed pancakes, you won't be disappointed.  When parking, use the metered parking, unless you want to stay a while and shop the strip.  Service is fast, so you'll be in and out in about 30 minutes.",1,positive
"Best buffet on the strip. Hands down. Server was very friendly and attentive.  The food was great, definitely coming back here",1,positive
"The only comfort food on the strip as far as I'm concerned. Very good wine list at reasonable prices, too. Can be a long wait if you hit it at the wrong time, though. And service, like everywhere in Las Vegas, is hit or miss, but never terrible.",1,positive
"This is my favorite spot in the strip, too bad they keep messing up on food 3 several time in a row. But they made up for it by giving us another champagne or free breakfast. Must try this place, the scenery is very good, make sure you get a table in atrium area.",1,positive
"For a chain, this was awful. It's north of the Strip, near the Stratosphere, in a not-so-great area. The inside is dark and drab. The restroom was dirty and broke while we were there. The food was okay, the omelettes were bigger than at most IHOP's, but still, nothing wonderful. Avoid, unless you're really hungover and need this stuff. But there's Denny's right on the Strip, so...",0,negative
"Fantastic French dip sandwich. Burger was really good too.  Mixed green salad was fantastic, right mixture of flavors. If you're looking for a restaurant on the strip and you don't want to spend too much, don't think twice.",1,positive
"Nice atmosphere but the steak was terrible. I've had better at Applebee's. Had the bone-in ribeye but it was over cooked, fatty (as opposed to marbled) and tough.  ( I didn't want to wait another 30 minutes to send it back). For $120 a person you can find much better on the Strip.\n\nService was ok though.",0,negative
"Not the greatest experience..  Here's why, poor and inefficient managment..  Too expensive (not enough selection of food for the money you paid). My napkin had food and lipstick on it for the last person who used it..  Which made me sick. But one good thing was the food,  the food was well made and full of taste..  Alot of other better buffets on the strip. NOT WORTH THE WAIT IN LINE FOR 1 HOUR AND 45 MIN.",0,negative
"It is a diner in the Strip.  Staff is friendly, food is good.    They require a $9.00 minimum order for credit/debit cards.  Most menu items are in the $7 range.",1,positive
Great Mexican food!! Very  Good chips and the flavors are great! The atmosphere is very nice. Drinks pricey ... But that's everywhere on the strip. \nI like the black beans they use . It's also little more healthy than traditional  Mexican food.,1,positive
"tasty 24hr food. tried dosai, idli, uthappam, and veg briyani.\neverything was good, except idli.\n\nit's little pricey for the amount. but in the strip, it's acceptable.\n\nconvenient location, if you walk to this place or take the bus or park in circus circus.\nrivera is one of the very old casino's, they still have their dirt from the day opened. including the slowest elevator in their parking.",1,positive
Food is good as always. Cool design outside and single golden arches make this a cool spot to hit up after the club or gambling on the strip.,1,positive
Best steakhouse on the strip. Be prepared to pay the price - but worth every ounce. Make sure you reserve in advance otherwise you will be stuck with a slot that might not fit your hunger schedule. \n\nRecommendable.,1,positive
Great hole in the wall place. The food was great and I will mos def go back again. And Lola was an awesome host. If you are looking for a good place to eat that is off the strip go to Lola's. Yum Yum.,1,positive
"Second best tuna sandwich on the strip. (1st is Earl's of Sandwich at PH).\nBest fruit salad with yogurt that I've tasted in a long time!\n\nWarning tho: Shoes and shirts or No service.\nI learned this the hard way after a day at the Boulevard Pool. Because they are right-next-to the pool, I assume I coulda rolled in there in my barefoot bikini wear but, NO.",1,positive
"We have the most fun sitting at the bar for Happy Hour. Cocktails are the best you'll find on the strip and especially when your drinks are made by Christian and Eric-they know how to properly shake a cocktail. Appetizers are a perfect taste of delicious flavors-shrimp 'n grits, freshest oysters and fish 'n chips-the fish is so light.",1,positive
Great place to go for breakfast near the strip. Try the little boy blue special if you want yummy blueberry pancakes. Service is above decent. Not the best but not bad at all.,1,positive
"Like all strip restaurants it is way overpriced. The food is, at best, acceptable. Worst of all is the attitude of too m any of the staff. It is far from welcoming and displays an overwhelming lack of class except perhaps low class. Worth avoiding.",0,negative
"Very disappointed. Couldn't wait to check out this place for Restaurant Week. Checked the restaurant hours online (11am-2am on a Saturday) and made the trek to the Strip during NASCAR weekend. Fought the traffic and the crowds just to arrive to a restaurant that was roped off and closed. The hostess was still behind the ropes and informed us that they had \""""issues\"""" today and would not be opening for the day until 6pm. Not impressed when a place is not open during their posted hours.  Will not be returning again.",0,negative
"A friend and I had dinner here last night. The food was delicious! I got the scampi stuffed chicken, and my friend got the daily special scallops. The service was excellent, and they gave us a free slice of cheesecake for dessert since it was our first time. My only complaints are that the prices are a bit steep, and the chairs are pretty hard and uncomfortable. However, as I mentioned before, the staff are incredible, and the food is really good. Off the Strip is worth a try, and I'll definitely be back.",1,positive
"Holy cow, this place is good.  My boyfriend and I had wrote down the address as a place to go in Las Vegas, and when the GPS brought us here, we almost didn't get out of the car!  The strip mall is shady looking, but have no fear, the food is amazing!  The staff was helpful, and the service was prompt.  If I lived in Las Vegas, I think I would become a regular here.  Everything was amazing!",1,positive
My favorite off the strip but still near the strip local restaurant in town. Amazing Italian food and first class service.,1,positive
"So ya it's cheap.... But you will pay in other ways. I spent little money, but lost some of my soul here. \n\nFirst of all, this place is in a terrible location.  At one mile from the Strip, be prepared to take a lot of taxis or walk the desolate distance (which is no fun drunk and no fun sober). There's no coffee, there is no good restaurants save for tacos el Gordo And there are no good bars nearby.\n\nThis isn't located on the new nor the old strip..... It's just nowhere.",0,negative
I love this spot! Pina Colada & Strawberry = Daiquiri heaven! They put just the right amount of alcohol in their mix and an extra shot is only $1! Holla! lol \n\nWe stayed @ the PH Towers so this location was perfect!!!!!!!!!!! Super convenient and well priced compared to another competitors around the strip!,1,positive
"Can't wait to dine here again! The food was amazing and reasonably priced for a quality strip restaurant. The dessert definitely made it into my top 5 desserts to date. White Chocolate Framboise! I can't stop thinking about it. The ambiance is very elegant and lively. Overall, just a pleasant dining experience. I noticed they do a lunch & dinner prefixe as well as a daily happy hour menu, which I can't wait to try.",1,positive
"Diner style, great menu, lots of variety.  Helpful waitress.  Food was great!  I nice break and just one block from the Strip!",1,positive
"OMG!  By far, the best lunch on the strip.\n\nI had the white fish ceviche.  WOW!  \n\nAnd the sandwhiches which are Spanish themed, are great.\n\nThink, i had a burger at the ESPN Zone and it was $14.  I go to Julians, and it's less.  And SO MUCH MORE CLASS!\n\nThe Gazpacho is excellent.  Comes with every lunch.\n\nENJOY!",1,positive
Where can 2 dine on steak on the strip for less than $100? Mon Ami is one option. Food is solid.. particularly liked the frites. Atmosphere is awesome too. A great mid-range type place when you are looking for a nice dinner but don't want to drop hundreds.,1,positive
"Why is it so far away from society? Looks like it can be part of Aria, Vdara and Cosmo.  \n\nCame for the buffet, which was amazing. Very modern look and feel, sign up for the members club card, get free $5 credit, which can turn into thousands of dollars! \n\nJust wish it was closer to the strip, but just for the buffet I wouldn't mind the drive.",1,positive
"What can I say?  I've only been to the bar area downstairs for dessert, light snack, drinks.  The service always great, which is rare for a strip restaurant, and so far the food I've had has been very good.  These are the reasons we keep going back.",1,positive

"If you're tired of waiting in line at all the big hotels and want to eat brunch off the strip, this is where you should go.  All the plates we ordered we're filling and large.  Some noteworthy items on the menu: Chicken fried steak, pumpkin and banana bread, and the corned beef hash!",1,positive

"We walked to this place from the strip. The walk is through some less than glamorous streets but it is totally worth it. My wife had a spudtastic which was huge and delicious. She had it with pulled pork on it-- great choice. I went for the brisket dog which was amazing. It is a hot link with brisket, cheese, and a huge pile of fried onions. The service was great. The ambiance was, well, appropriate. Bottom line, I would go here again and again.",1,positive
Yummy worth getting off the strip for!!,1,positive
Went here for Sunday morning brunch. After eating all weekend on the strip I was so glad to go to a non rape pricing place. We ordered a scramble a short stack with blueberries and a skillet. Everything came out great and the banana nut muffin warm and amazing. The coffee was something that could use work tasted like foldgers to me. However the flavored creamers made up for it lol. \n\n4 people 51.00 plus tip. Service was great food was good. Definitely would go back if I was in the area.,1,positive
"Food - very delicious\nHighlight: sake orenji, wagyu and tuna belly sushi\n\nService - everyone was nice and have knowledge about the food being served\n\nIt's worth the trip off the strip",1,positive
So good great price for food on the strip. I had the fish and chips which were to die for good. Crunchy batter with moist flaky fish perfection. My son loved his chicken fried steak. Waited outside to avoid the smoky casino. Only downside was our wait which was better then 30 min. and just as long to get our food. I was starving by the time we got it but for the.price and high quality food it was worth the wait I'd say.,1,positive
Great little get-a-away from the strip mexican food. It was recomended by a valet guy and it was great.,1,positive
"Oh, why bother?\n\nOf all the places you can go on the strip, don't pick here.\n\nUnless you are deliriously hungry and out of your mind (like we were), please choose anywhere else - literally.\n\nSimply put - cafeteria food.\n\nMeal and calories wasted.",0,negative

If you don't want to deal with the buffets on the strip...this is the next best place to have breakfast. At first by the environment you'd think that the food would be sub-par at best...boy I have never been so happy to be wrong. This place is amazing!,1,positive
"The owner of 28GO is also the chef. His food is incredible. I have followed him to 4 or 5 different restaurants. My wife and I go to 28GO almost every week. The prices are very low but the flavor and quality rivals anything you would find at a top restaurant on the Strip. I have not found anything there I don't like. My favorites are Ribs vs. Thighs, Crabcake Sliders, and the Fillet Mignon. I have also been a fan of his jasmine-infused sake (served hot) for years. \nAny time friends come to town, I take them to 28GO.",1,positive
This is a very nice place!  We had dinner here and the place is awesome!  Self serve fountain drinks is a great concept....the tables are friendly and the poker room was well set up.  A first class joint off the strip!,1,positive
Nice patio area. Right by the strip. The food was really...mediocre. Price to food quality ratio is a bad bet for the customers. The problem with restaurants on the LV strip is the high overhead costs. This means nice ambiance but sub par food and entrees. Unless you like wasting your money. This place is way too over priced. I'm not a fan.,0,negative
"One of the best buffets on the strip. The layout of the food is in'shops' and breaks the food into groupings based on the area. There are countless stations filled with great food that never fails to satisfy. \nThe selection is always vast and varied to cater to everyone in your group. There is often a wait, but it's well worth it!",1,positive
"Went on Memorial Day weekend so the price was a bit more expensive ($32) than usual. But considering the fact that the buffets on the strip would have been ($45+), it was a good deal.\n\nThe food there was fantastic and our server was on top of everything. Whatever small thing we asked for, like an extra spoon, she was on it.\n\nI think the best parts were their variety of food and dessert.",1,positive
"Wonderful ambiance, tasty beer selections, out of this world food, decedent dessert, and very attentive service. Honey Salt is a definite Do Not Miss far from The Strip.",1,positive
"Had a very bad experience here and will not be back. My husband and I used to love this 24 hour cafe right in the middle of the strip. \n\nThey must have new owners because the recipes are different and the portions have been reduced.\n\nUsed to be a great spot to refuel at 4am or anytime of the day. Now, I will not even stop in for a soda. Service was horrible and waitress was very rude when we asked for drinks or any necessities!  Not going back EVER!",0,negative
"Great food, great service, nice ambience, and reasonable prices (for the Strip). So far, this is the best Chinese restaurant I've found on the strip in a resort.",1,positive
"This place has a great happy hour, decent food, but slow service.  It's a little off the strip, but if you can find it, you won't be disappointed in the Mexican Food.  The only thing that I was craving was traditional chips and salsa brought to the table to keep me drinking while thinking of something to order.  Chips and Salsa were like $5 and there wasn't enough salsa.",1,positive
"Not for the faint of heart (or wallet)!\n\nThe food here is very good. Interesting selection of fresh fish, giant prawns and the octopus starter is great. We were given a prime table with a view of the Strip and attentive service. Be warned, however, that the prices are extortionate! Dinner for 4 with a bottle of wine, whole fish ($270) and four giant prawns ($117), two appetizers, two sides and two desserts plus coffee totaled $850. That's approximately double what I'd expected to pay when I made the reservation.",1,positive
"I found a piece of food heaven here. \n\nGreat food, excellent ambience, attentive service, and a specular view of the Valley and the Strip. \n\nBe forewarned, it will cost ya. If you want to dine like royalty, it will cost you a king-ransom. But there is always the buffet downstair or the In-n-Out Burger joint across the freeway.\n\nAn excellent value, as always!!!",1,positive
Stay away from the starches and indulge on all the wonderful selections of meats they have there and assorted seafood and then finish off with tasty desserts and you will be so full you have to walk the strip just so it will relieve the giant lump in your stomach,1,positive
BAM!!! That was  some gooooood eatin.\n\n10-15 minutes off the strip but so worth it. The spicy miso broth was so tasty especially after cooking the meat and the veggies. For $20 you get a large portion of prime rib eye and veggies. So worth it.,1,positive
Fantastic food!  Our table of four all shared -- no one was disappointed. Server was excellent - additional staff joked around with us. Great atmosphere.  Price was what we expected on the Strip.  If you want cheap -- McDonald's is nearby so don't complain about price.  You get what you pay for.  Will definitely come back.  BTW - the Mac & Cheese Burger was out-of-the-world!,1,positive
"By far my favorite buffet on the strip. The prices have gone up since the first time I went but I'm not surprised. I Love the food and the individual servings. The dessert section is Amazing, but they give tiny scoops of gelato now. :-/ Still the other pastries are delish!!! \nHighly recommend this buffet",1,positive
Get there early to avoid the wait on the weekend.  Good place to get away from the buzz on the strip.  Corned beef hash fans will not be disappointed.,1,positive
"The Grand Lux is a great place to eat if you just can't manage to head down the strip for a steak and eggs special.  There's always a wait to eat here even if it's 3am.  The food is good.  The prices are high, but you do get a lot of food.\n\nMixed opinions about the staff.  One time I was here the waiter was a real ass.  But other than that, I've had good experiences.  If you can't find something on the menu that looks good to you, ask the waiter for something that you'd like to eat.  Sometimes they'll have it.",1,positive
"I wanted so much to love this place but alas we did not. We went for lunch and the food was so so, a bit pricey even for the strip, and the outside deck wasnt even open. Not bad but not great. 2.5 stars.",0,negative
"Tasty burgers and a great happy hour. Where else can you go for dollar drinks on the strip? Go see Daizee, she knows how to move fast while providing some tasty beverages of the alcoholic persuasion! Make sure to get there early, it can get pretty busy being such a popular place :)",1,positive
Great little get-a-away from the strip mexican food. It was recomended by a valet guy and it was great.,1,positive
"Why is it so far away from society? Looks like it can be part of Aria, Vdara and Cosmo.  \n\nCame for the buffet, which was amazing. Very modern look and feel, sign up for the members club card, get free $5 credit, which can turn into thousands of dollars! \n\nJust wish it was closer to the strip, but just for the buffet I wouldn't mind the drive.",1,positive
"Value meals... that's where it's at for cheap eating, as long as you're not looking for healthy.  And egg, biscuits and gravy for $2.  You know it's cheap when your tea costs more then your meal.  \nI wouldn't call it a good meal by any means, but if you're broke on the strip from plugging all your $ into an one armed bandit, it'll fill the hole in your gut (but not your soul... it's a lost cause).\nBut... free wi-fi!  Hard to find on the strip.",0,negative
"This is the place you would call the Local's Strip Casino, near the strip but not! It's prices on food are a lot cheaper. in the cafe, food is good only problem is service is real slow especial on shift change, but hey, you get what you pay for! Over all it's more value for the buck,",1,positive
"A great alternative to going to Pamela's in the strip if you don't want to wait for a table. This P&G has a lot of the same menu items like the crepe style hot cakes and lyonnaise potatoes, as well as a variety of omelets. It's also an old school pharmacy, which adds some charm. The service is good and the prices are reasonable.",1,positive
Attitude and crap service are pretty spot on here.  Plenty of other mexican joints to eat at.  But if you really want to eat overlooking the strip I would just head upstairs to maggianos.,0,negative
"We were looking for a Banana Split for Dinner!  Ok... like you've never done it!  We stopped at several places on the strip,  but no Banana Splits.  The stop at the Paris Brasserie didn't have what we wanted but had so many options!   We ordered the Fondue and 3 other desserts. The service, the presentation and the view were exceptional!   Great place to meet and get a sugar high!    And if you fine the Ultimate Banana Split....please let me know!",1,positive
Del Taco right on the strip?? and open 24/7? Equals Satisfaction!,1,positive
"came here this weekend after they had renovated and it has only gotten better since last time we came here.  This is buy far the best buffet on the strip.  We were here 2.5 hrs eating alof of good crab all kinds  and other seafood as well as meats and many other things especally deserts, they had my jusbands two favorite gelatos, orange shebert and mint and chip.  The food here never disappoints.  Will for sure be back here the next time we are in town and will have to try the brunch buffer here as well.",1,positive
Stops just about everywhere on the strip but the downside is that you need exact change for the machines. 6 bucks for a 2 hr ticket 8 bucks for 24 hours or 20 bucks for 3 day pass.,1,positive
"The New York Strip was amazing, but overpriced in my opinion. Sides are not very large; splitting with another person left me wanting more. Great atmosphere and staff.",1,positive
What a bunch of crap! You can't bring an outside drink in and it's located off the strip?! Food is mediocre and expensive. I would pass,0,negative
"One of my new favorite places to hang out on the strip, the atmosphere is incredible, and eaten at lots of great restaurants, have to check out the exit of the parking structure, the reflective walls are really cool.",1,positive
"It is in a random location, way off the strip. \n\n+1 delish garlic fries\n+1 really clean inside\n+1 great prices\n+1 Bacon cheeseburger is THE BEST\n\nI wouldn't make a special drive for these burgers, but it definitely a great place for a good burger.",1,positive
"This place deserves some major props for being one of few great happy hour joints, serving up drinks and appetizers that are actually affordable on the strip! The food is decent, the prices are good, and it's a nice change of pace from the usual pregaming at the buffets or pregaming at the hotels. \n\nMake sure you come early to avoid long waits. And for something different from your half yard, try the fish bowl and I guarantee you a good time.",1,positive
Came on a Friday mid-day. We were seated right away and the server gave us plenty of time to decide.\n\n\nThe pre-meal bread was very yummy. The menu is very extensive and there was so much to choose from. My friend and I settled with the Asian Nachos.. Very yummy! Definitely good to split. They were very rich.\n\nI would come back here. Decent prices for the strip and something for everyone.,1,positive
I was here July 5th. The chocolate chip and bacon waffle was so good I am trying to find a substitute here in Los Angeles. \nThe patio overlooks the strip and is great for observing the activity on the street. Our waiter was very nice.,1,positive
"This place never disappoints. Ask for a table on the strip patio. Worth the wait! Oh now I love to watch the crazy drive by while shipping a French martini. Goat cheese appie is delish! Have had several items here, all good. Very good burgers. Strong pours in drinks and wonderful service. Great spot for lunch or a quick appetizer and drink while walking the strip!",1,positive
Our favorite restaurant that we went to on the strip. Easy access since it was in our hotel. Best margaritas I have ever had and amazing food. The staff was wonderful and the service was quick! We were happy to see they had a gluten free menu for me.,1,positive
"Killer burgers! Not cheap, but the best fast food burger around, I prefer it to In n Out. Real ice cream milkshakes as well, that are excellent. They have added an outdoor patio/bar  for the strip location- now its even better!",1,positive
"One of my favorite burger & shake joints on the strip.\n\nBeing Canadian with our ridiculous food safety laws, this is my goto place on the strip for a medium rare burger. Massive menu with every option you can think of. \n\nHuge fan of the chocolate shakes as well. \n\nGreat place for a hangover cure meal or Vegas pregame. \n\nTip: I've always sat at the bar with the friendly staff and monsterous TVs.",1,positive
"Ok, so the food is OUT OF THIS WORLD! Like, knock you on your a** good. You will want to slip into a food coma afterwards. The location is sketchy. In a bad area of you ask me, but if you take a moment to pretend that you aren't surrounded by a buffet of strip clubs the food is honestly worth the risk of getting mugged. Seriously.",1,positive
"We were there on December 26th, Friday.  I thought it can be crowded with  a busy shopping day, but it was almost empty.  We had great service and was able to kill sometime before heading to the airport to drop off the guests.\n\nBang bang shrimp was good. Corn chowder with lobster meat was very good and I even ordered seconds. The burgers were okay. \n\nThe location is great in town square for us. Away from the craziness of the strip. Our friends who stayed in the strip for 4 days appreciated the quietness there.",1,positive
"Been here a few times over the years. Good choice if you're not in the mood for buffets.  We sat in the covered patio which offers a view of the strip without having to sit on the patio. We got the steak which was moist & tender. And escargots & bread is pretty good. Food & service is good, just A little pricey, dinner for 2 with drinks just under $100.",1,positive
"worthwhile to go here if you stay near paris, cosmopolitan or bellagio\nsuper cheap food on the strip. \n$6 for a warm sandwich. \nI had the earl's club. \nThe sandwich is toasted, filled with melting cheese! \nI will come here again",1,positive
"Underwhelmed at Michael Mina's StripSteak.  Just meh.  The fries were in tiny little pieces, and not crispy enough.  The steaks were not of the same caliber we have become used to at Mastro's.  The atmosphere is fun and lively and the people watching is good. The service is nothing to snark at, and I like the fact that the room feels masculine in nature.  I have been twice and both times I was a little unhappy.  They could do better.  I won't go again.",0,negative
"pizza's good.  price is actually not too bad for a slice...when you factor in it's on the STRIP, in the COSMO.  drinks kinda pricey - but like I said...you're in the COSMO.  Pretty long line, I mean i'm sure it's gets enough action from Marquee.  Didnt really think about that, until we saw all the drunk partyers from the dayclub",1,positive
This was a great little place tucked away off the strip. The food came out really fast and was packed with flavor. It was perfect to share with a ton of variety. We went on a Tuesday night and it was packed! The Sangria and Mojitos were awesome as well!\n\nI'd definitely return here for a great deal!,1,positive
Had a great lunch at Miller's. If you want a good priced meal on the strip with great staff give it a try. If there go to the back bar and see Clay the bartender. He will make your experience even better.,1,positive
"The only reason we went here was because the Luxor was offering $20 off coupon for staying with them.\n\nSo we got the chicken fried rice which was okay and sesame chicken.  The sesame chicken wasn't that great and was served rather cold. \n\nThis place is outragiously overpriced and by the time the coupon is used it is like eating at a regular restaurant on the strip with better food.\n\nThe service was okay not anything to rave about.\n\nIf you are offered same coupon, i suggest using it at the bars.",0,negative
"Great \""""social hour\"""". Good wine for $5 and appetizers for $7 to match. High quality, low cost and cool atmosphere. Bar tenders know what they are talking about and a cool atmosphere. A refreshing treat compared to the hustle bustle and touristy action of the strip. Lobster and corn side is AMAZING. Highly recommend for multiple reasons.",1,positive
"I have been there for brunch. The view of strip from the patio is great. The limited menu is good but not outstanding. Service has been very attentive. Almost empty every time I go. Decor is elegant,  simple and relaxing. Moderate prices at brunch but certainly not cheap.",1,positive
"Hands down, best buffet on the strip. For $45, the weekend brunch has pretty much every food you can think of AND bottomless mimosa! The line was about 30 minutes long but worth the wait. Crepe station was delicious, they make the crepes fresh and you choose your own toppings. Even the crab was better than most buffet crab. Love this place. A must go if you are into all you can eat awesome buffet style food!",1,positive
"This is, well, kind of in a strip club. There's a large strip club and a little sign for el dorado.  I was apprehensive at fist, but so glad we went in. Great food, reasonable prices, great drinks",1,positive
"Mon Ami Gabi is one of my favorites on the strip. It has a true parisian feel, and a very professional staff. Their food is great, and at good value on the strip, and an extensive wine list. The waiters know the wine as well, so don't be afraid to ask for recomendations. \n\nBe sure to make a reservation if you're going for brunch/lunch on the weekend, it's a popular spot.",1,positive
"The best lunch on the strip... great eats, reasonable prices and a fantastic atmosphere*** back for a third year in a row, still the best!",1,positive
"Best restaurant I have ever eaten at.  Not the best location, but inside is great.  Service is wonderful.  The food is better than anything I have had on the strip.",1,positive
"The view and service at this place is outstanding, probably the best on the strip that I've seen so far. It's confusing to understand how the dress code should be, because i see people all decked out and dressed to the 9's, and at the same time I see people in shorts and sandals. I try to go somewhere in-between. Drinks are pretty expensive, but expect that from a high end place like this one.",1,positive
"Food presentation great, nice location overlooking strip,  service slow, price too high for the quality.  Maybe go back to see if they stepped it up on the service and any food special.  Other than that, better places on and off the strip.",0,negative
This place has a super cool atmosphere  and the food was incredible!! We ordered the MTO breakfast with a pancake. It was a perfect way to start our Saturday. This place is a little ways off the strip but definitely worth the drive!,1,positive
They have fesenjan and that's hard to find. Athen fries are wonderful here! Hooka lounge is a great evening on the sideline from the strip. Cheers!,1,positive
They always get my order wrong. The waitress looked like she was on drugs. happy hour pricing is good. great patio seating to view the whole strip from henderson. Just dont expect  your food to come out correctly.,0,negative
I expected more from this place. Not worth the trip if you're on the strip.,0,negative
One of my favorite steak houses on the strip. Be prepared for the best steak of your life.,1,positive
"I was not expecting such a great dining experience on the strip at such an affordable price. The food is delicious, the d\u00e9cor is beautiful and the fountains are RIGHT THERE!\n\nI highly recommend this place.",1,positive
"Now my go-to place in the land of stripmalls.\n\nBe careful, they bring the spicy if you ask for it.",1,positive
"SO SO SO good. Local or tourist, you need to come here at least once and try it out for yourself. If there's anything I could ever go for, it would be Holsteins. I hate that I have to partially drive on the strip to get here as a local, but it's so worth it to me every time. \n\nBuffalo Chicken Dip is a must try; looks funky, texture is different, but it's so delicious.\nAll of their shakes are TDF. \nAlso try their homemade ketchup!",1,positive
My wife and I have gone there a few times. The last time that we where there I asked for a glass if water. The waitress walked over to the bar and grabbed the 2 used glasses of water that she pulled off a table. That people were drinking out of. then she put a little ice in it and brought it to me. OMG!!!!. my wife and I eat on the strip all most nightly....  I will never go there again,0,negative
"We ate here twice, once for dinner and once for breakfast. It's inexpensive compared to other places on the strip and in the Stratosphere, but the quality of food is variable. The food itself looks, feels and tastes processed, and in every case was under-seasoned (or maybe not seasoned at all).\n\nService was really good and the retro decor cool, but the food quality lets it down.",0,negative
They're open 24 hours a day and that's the main draw here after the 3am closing of the pizza place in the hotel is done for the day. \n\nNothing fancy here just plain ol' food that fills you up after a night out in Sin City.,0,negative
Save your money. Go to panda express on the strip. Youll get more food and it'll taste better.,0,negative
"I come here for lunch whenever I visit the strip. The food is average but the Mongolian grill is awesome. They also have a really big variety of sushi rolls. Most importantly, the service is excellent and everyone is friendly. They are always busy and crowded so I would come either early around 11 or late around 1.",1,positive
If you are starving late night and close/in MGM then ok... otherwise dont make a special trip to go here food is ok nothing new or exciting but its pricey for what you get.,0,negative
"This place is nothing special.\n\nYou get many options for hotdog toppings, and the food isn't bad, but it's definitely overrated and there are better places to eat on the strip.",0,negative
"I found a piece of food heaven here. \n\nGreat food, excellent ambience, attentive service, and a specular view of the Valley and the Strip. \n\nBe forewarned, it will cost ya. If you want to dine like royalty, it will cost you a king-ransom. But there is always the buffet downstair or the In-n-Out Burger joint across the freeway.\n\nAn excellent value, as always!!!",1,positive
"This place is not far at all from the strip, so people without cars can make the lil trek up here, too.\n\nCome during hh, when all drinks are half off from 3-5pm. I got the sparkling sangria for $3.50, which was sweet and tasty! The steak and mushroom skewers were super filling, loved how the mac n cheese came out hot and crispy, and those dates were unique. Btw I LOVED the bread with the almond butter (had about 8 or so slices of it!).\n\nWe all only needed about one dish to get pretty full. Yummm I'll be back!",1,positive
"Their advertisement in the the Weekly showed a patio area where you could see the Strip and the lights... don't count on it. You get to stare at Chuckie Cheese and a few other strip mall buildings. The fire pit outside was nice and our waiter was OK. Nothing special, although we didn't try any food.",0,negative
My date and I sat outside on the second level.  It offered a great view of the strip.\n\nService was prompt despite the crowd.  We didn't try the food.,1,positive
"10.14.10\n\nThis place is amazing!  If you can venture off the strip and try this place, please do so!\n\nKiki's Burger:\nTwo types of mushrooms, caramelized bacon, sweet onion marmalade, gruyere, with garlic aioli on the side.  Um, are you hungry yet?",1,positive
I love staying here. You get free breakfast and free shuttle rides to the strip. This place is always Quiet the staff is friendly and it's clean. Really I always come back here because of the free biscuits and gravy in the mornings :p,1,positive
"Some of the business on the strip, including this one, charge a cnf (concession & franchise fees). These fees goes directly to the owner pocket. It is like an automatic tip of 3-5% to the owner on each build. On top of that the real taxes are calculate on top of the cnf. Which mean you are paying taxes on top of taxes.",0,negative
I work on the strip and I love Earl of Sandwich. Its a great alternative to the employee dining room and doesnt break the bank. Be prepared to wait in line as this place is usually busy but it usually doesnt take too long. Located inside the Planet Hollywood its easy to access from the strip,1,positive

"My review is mostly for the buffet, which at $12.99 for the Mother's Day lunch was outstanding.  My friends and I read about this spot in a web site long ago and so when we have a car, we make the trek out to this locals' place where you basically get a great buffet for 1/2 the price of the strip.  Great selection, fajita/quesadilla made-to-order guy, ribs, chicken, garlic bread, excellent chocolate cream pie.  Usually, they have a great chili bar but didn't this time.  Nice drink refilling.  Clean bathrooms.",1,positive
"For a resturant that is right on the strip, this place was NO DICE. Service was subpar, the servers seemed rushed and flustered at all times and food was... well the same as the rest so I guess that's a plus.",0,negative
This place is awesome. Stopped in for a quick bite to eat before hitting the strip. It's reasonably priced and has a cool ambiance. You can sit inside or outside. You will need to drive or can it from the strip. The food was tender and well seasoned. The portion sizes are large as well. Service is great.,1,positive
"Easy spot in the D Casino/Hotel to grab a hot dog and some chili cheese fries.. nothing wrong with any of that but the hot dogs are something like $8 each. Pretty high prices for that kind of situation. I don't say I wouldn't go there again, but it wouldn't be my first choice.",0,negative
"What? $8 a shot and almost $15 for a drink?! This aint the strip!\n\nFood is good, very Filipino. Actually, it is Filipino! I always get their sisig. Went here during lent and my religious friends couldn't eat pork. Damn it. So tried the chicken sisig instead, it's still delicious and tastes like pork!\n\n2 stars because of the pricing...come on, I consider this place a dive bar. It ain't that classy! Service is aiiggghht. Drinks are aiiggghht. \n\nStill, 2 stars. Don't get stabbed in the parking lot!",0,negative
"When you need to get off the strip its worth the drive. Food was tasty, fresh and fast. Many Vegetarian options and friendly staff",1,positive
One of the best meals I had on the strip. Unbelievable service (thanks Russell!). The mac and cheese is a must. Great wine suggestion and the steaks was out of this world. Beautiful setting and we weren't even outside. \n\nIf you're looking for a high end steakhouse with a classic setting and old school service give this place your business. Call for reservations. I found open table didn't have many options but I got in when I called.,1,positive
I love this place. The Lobster Curry is the must have dish. I convinced 5 other people at my table to order it and no one was disappointed. The house made ice cream was the perfect way to end my meal.\n\nAnd I would be remiss if I didn't mention the view! The strip shines beneath you. Tip: use the bathroom on the bar/lounge side. There are floor to ceiling windows in the stalls. At night it is incredible!,1,positive
"Awesome tacos, Quesadillas etc...\n\nA must stop if going downtown (from the strip).",1,positive
"Very average! Very expensive, Atmosphere & Decor is bland at best... $42.00 for a 750ml Delerium Tremens???? $21.00 for a 10.5 inch pizza. I know it's The Strip but, Block 16 Restaurant group is out of line on this one.",0,negative
Found out that there was a Filipino restaurant on the strip so we decided to get breakfast here.  The employees seemed somewhat rude... I guess they have to deal with drunk people a lot but it's no excuse.  The food was nothing special and they charged my cousin like $2-3 for a fried egg. \n\nThey sell a few snacks from the PI as well such as chips.,0,negative
Very fun casual setting with an outdoor patio right on the strip great for people watching... I have not tried their food but this is a must stop to try their famous frozen hot chocolate!  It's a nice sweet treat that comes in multiple flavors (some even with alcohol) to help beat the Vegas summer heat,1,positive
"Best restaurant I have ever eaten at.  Not the best location, but inside is great.  Service is wonderful.  The food is better than anything I have had on the strip.",1,positive
"What great atmosphere.  So nice to get off 'The Strip' and go to a 'real' restaurant.  The service is great, the food is decent, the portions are huge, and the unlimited table wine and garlic bread will shut you down!",1,positive
"This place is quite aways from the Strip but it was well worth the drive. Food was very good but a couple dishes were not to our liking, that is the reason for four star rating. \n     The service was very friendly and helpful. Restaurant was very clean, especially when compared to other Filipino restaurants I have been to.. \nBBQ chicken kabobs were the best as well as Lentil beans.",1,positive
"Killer breakfast at this place, and I'm not big on breakfast. I definitely enjoyed the giant selection on the menu.  You might not eat the rest of the day though--generous portions!\n\nIt's also away from the insanity of the strip--which I found favorable.",1,positive
A delicious sh*thole off the strip. Only tried the original Stromboli which was excellent. A true dive worth visiting!,1,positive
"Food is so so, (pricey build your burger, type of place). Service is eh. Stumbled here to watch the packers roll over the ravens. \n\nBar girl serves me a beer when i wanted water, this place has no personality considering its right behind the strip... you're better off staying on the strip.",0,negative
I typically don't go down to the strip but when I do I at least expect to get high quality food (even if it is overpriced).  I realize this place is just a coffee shop but I never expected they would serve a steak that had been tenderized with papaya enzymes.  seriously gross.  the crab cake was ok but the best part was the remoulade.  also had a chopped salad that wasn't bad but it was over dressed.,0,negative
"The environment and decor is very nice.  Great view of the strip too but our lunch was over 100 dollars and it was just my gal and me.  We had NO alcohol.  Had two burgers, lobster bisque and an app.  I'm pretty sure the beef had turned.  It made me sick.  The servers are all like robots with zero personality.  They speak to you like you're six years old with that fake-ish tone.  Won't be back.",0,negative
"Call me crazy, but I really enjoyed this place. You can get a ton of food for a decent price while sitting outside watching the \""""statues\"""" near the trevi fountain at the forum. It is a nice place to sit and relax after walking the strip or shopping all day. The minestrone soup, pizza, bread, salads, etc were all 2 steps higher than an Olive garden, but not as ritzy as say Spago. Save the money and the long wait in line and just eat at Trevi.",1,positive
"In case you have a hard time finding where this place is..it is literally right next to Sapphires.  With that being said, there are no strippers here but there is some delicioso food. The chef is friendly and welcoming, talked to us a bit and sat us down.  Street tacos are better than Tacos y Tacos and the chips are nom. Should give this place a try before their grand opening in August!",1,positive
"Oh i like this place! I bought a groupon so it came out real cheap. Anyways, the food was bomb. My favorite side was the italian and mid-eastern food. Be ready to wait in line and to eat a lot! The dessert bar looked like paradise! I think is the cheapest buffet on the strip but the food is real good. Is a must try place.",1,positive
Great place off the strip. Yelp it. You wont regret it. Large portions. Wait is about 20 min. for large groups less for 2.,1,positive
"This place sells half off/discounted tickets for shows (comedians, singers, Cirque du Soleil shows, male revue shows, etc) and restaurants/buffets! They have a few television screens that show you what they have discounted offers for.  The wait can be about 15-20 minutes to purchase your tickets but its definitely worth it. They have a few locations on the strip so make sure to keep your eyes open!",1,positive
"Honestly unless you like cheap ass piss beer, $15 daiquiris, fried food and a cheesy light show I suggest you stay strip bound.  IMHO DT is just hype.  Sure it's cool if it's your first visit check it out, but I would much rather party on the strip where there is a lot more to do.",0,negative
Great spot right on the strip. Lunch and breakfast are perfect for a heavy day of walking. The breakfast benny's are all good (tried them all) as well as the Nutella waffles. Make a reservation and prepare for $15 a person plus drinks. One of my fave spots to eat directly on the strip.  Great spot for the whole family if you sit outside.,1,positive
Love the free shuttle service from/to the airport including drop off service to the strip.\n\nThe chocolate cookies are like crack. :),1,positive
Great little get-a-away from the strip mexican food. It was recomended by a valet guy and it was great.,1,positive
Went with my girl here before heading to the strip.  Burgers were both Juicy and flavorfull.  We both Especially liked the bulgogi.  Garlic parm frys were good too.  Nice and crispy and were cooked in fresh oil.  I would come here again.,1,positive
"this place reeks of fish when you walk in and there are fruit flies everywhere.  Good place to dine if you're on a diet since you will surely lose your appetite.\n\nIf you find yourself at Rolands, do yourself a favor and leave and dine anywhere else in the Strip District.  Seriously.",0,negative
Worth taking a trip off the strip!!! The sushi is very fresh and absolutely delicious! The all you can eat is a great deal since it even includes sashimi! Get the sy special and Super white tuna! The chefs and the waiters are awesome! Great service and great food! Will be coming back!,1,positive
Very fun casual setting with an outdoor patio right on the strip great for people watching... I have not tried their food but this is a must stop to try their famous frozen hot chocolate!  It's a nice sweet treat that comes in multiple flavors (some even with alcohol) to help beat the Vegas summer heat,1,positive
I've been to Rosemary's twice and it has not dissapointed. My family came in from Europe and we decided to take them here. They said this is one of the best restaurants they've ever been too. The service and food are unbeliveable. We even received a call two days after visit to see how we liked our dinner. I highly recommend this to everyone. It is worth the drive from The Strip!,1,positive
"We were looking for a great place to eat good food and not pay 'the strip' prices...and we found it here.\n\nGreat food (I had the Western omelet and home fries), great service, and a great price.  Everyone was full and we paid less than $10 each including drink. \n\nWould highly recommend.",1,positive
"I decided to give Willalby's a second chance since Lazy Janes had a 30 minute wait for a table. Willalby's was even worse. We got in, ordered, and then we waited an hour for our food. How hard is it to make some eggs and potatoes? The waiter said, \""""Oh, I forgot to tell you we had a wait,\"""" but the place wasn't that busy. Anyway, the food was okay, but definitely not worth an hour wait.",0,negative
Long wait but was worth it. Had fetticini Alfredo and strawberry smoothie. It was all good. Worth the time and cash.,1,positive
20min- coffee wait\n22min they found out they lost our order\n33m28sec to finally get our breakfast\n\nBreakfast was comped. Apologies accepted. \n\n\nFood- is dry maybe because I already judged it before tasting it and probably because the experience left a bad taste in my mouth\nWish it was a better experience.,0,negative
Took for ever just to get water and to take our order. We were there for over an hour before we got our food and it was cold. Will not return.,0,negative
"The wait on weekends can be pretty bad, and if you try to call ahead, you may wait on hold for 10-15 minutes. Hopefully they're working on that. I've had many good meals here, usually ribeye, a baked potato and broccoli with a side salad. The food is consistent. I have a gluten allergy, and they have a good gluten free menu.",1,positive
We were told it was going to be a 15 minute wait but waited at least 30.  My overall rating is highly satisfied.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place and cannot wait to go back to Las Vegas just to eat at this place again.,1,positive
"Called in an order for 4 sandwiches and only had to wait 2 or 3 minutes after we arrived for them. Good service, good sammies and happy eaters.",1,positive
"Huge proportions and great tasting food, that came out fast and hot. We waited 30 minutes on a Sunday morning but it went by quickly because we went downstairs and gambled. Give your self plenty of time when coming here because the service can be kind of slow.",1,positive

Waited 43 minutes for food. Was not busy when we walked in. No apologies. Others were served ahead of us. Many choices nearby. Choose wisely.,0,negative
If you have 45 minutes for them to give your order to someone else and then get upset because you expect a sandwich and a refund then this is definitely your place. The food is good but you have to consider if the hassle is worth it,0,negative

waited in like for like 20 minutes... got a seat.  it was one of those hot + humid days.. i was sweating bullets. but was saved after ordering few cold japanese brewskies.. food was very good.. fresh... kinda food u get at 3 star michelin without paying the prices.. ate in about 1 hour overall.. would definitely go back..,1,positive
"It's apparent the kitchen has no idea how to operate.  The food was good.  I was not upset with that. However 50 mins for bbq is absurd.  Bbq should be done. \n\nThe owners friend sat next to us and they had no problem getting food early with prompt service. We however, were not given the same respect or service from staff...\n\nIt's unfortunate because I was really looking forward to trying this place in hopes for good bbq in LV",0,negative
"The wait times were forever, but the crepes and eggs benedict were so delicious. I feel like it looks better then it is, but we did have an enjoyable meal. I don't know if I'd wait 40 minutes again....It serves a late breakfast when other places didn't. It seemingly has an adorable candy shop, but up close, the sweets are sub par in quality. Good server at the restaurant and adorable crepe chef display!",1,positive
I was greeted and seated promptly. Ordered special pho combo p1 and it was out in less than 3 minutes hot and delicious. Very impressive! The cigar smell is annoying but they can't do much about that as the neighboring shop is a cigar bar. Price is right. No complaints! I shall return.,1,positive
"Appetizer took forever,  then one entree comes out and mine was either forgotten or taken to another  table.  Restaurant was pretty dead when we arrived which left us wondering why the waitress was so unattentive .  It appeared  she chose to avoid us due to the fact that are  food  was taking forever. Manager comped my meal but it was a horrible dining  experience and I usually  like chili's won't be returning to this location. Your better off eating at a hot dog Stand!",0,negative
"Took way too long.  We waited over an hour for our food- the fryer broke then some how our food got mixed up.  We watched quite a few people arrive, eat and leave even before we had food!!",0,negative
I can back up Kendra's statement about the menus as well. We had to wait ten minutes for a menu because there were non available.,0,negative
"Horrid! Two hours!!! It took two hours from the time we sat down to get drinks, food, and our check-ridiculous!  If wasn't a leisure two hours, it was craning our necks-looking for our waitress, wondering if our food would ever come.  I don't know if they were just understaffed or what, but I had to go looking for my own fork :(\nWe ordered oysters Rockefeller, which were cold and tasteless. The lobster boil was no bueno the lobster was tough!\nNever again!",0,negative
"I don't know what time people seem to go to wait this long?? Ive gone here 4 times now and the longest I waited was 45 min (for dinner) I have nothing bad to say.  No  long wait times for me.. Pizza is out of this world.. the spedini-YUM, I can't wait to go back!",1,positive
"Went on here on a whim when the wait at Cowfish would've been an hour (on a Tuesday night).  Was seated within 15 minutes.  The food was outstanding, and I was literally disappointed when I realized I had cleaned my plate.\n\nIt's \""""New American\"""" cuisine.  While I'm not particularly sure what that means, whatever it is, is done extremely well.  Can't wait to go back, especially on a night where I get to dodge the trend-driven waits on hotspots like Cowfish.",1,positive
"Fast greets both at the door and the table.  Our server Marion was quick and knowledgeable, which helped us because we were starving and wanted everything on the menu.  The coffee braised beef and the spicy pork tacos were our faves!  And the street corn...AMAZING.  Can't wait to go try more tacos!  Loved it.",1,positive
"Wait time is ridiculous. There is no excuse to take 50 minutes to get a pita to a customer. We were not informed of any wait when we ordered. I watched the line extend out the door multiple times, then an employee would tell the people about the long wait and they would all leave. The place lost hundreds of dollars in revenue in the hour I was waiting there. Fries were ice cold.",0,negative
"The food is great. The wait is insane. I ordered online, they said it would be 20 minutes, it was 50 minutes. For three meals. Are they catching the fish?! Then they tell me that I'm having to wait because they had to fill a catering order. Well don't I feel special.",0,negative
We arrived early for lunch but still had to wait a good half hour before our lunch for two arrived.  And it was horrible.  My food look like it had been thrown on the plate. Slopped up the side and dried on the plate.   I ordered a toco and an enchilada.  Both were well below average especially in this city.  The other plate was a sandwich with avocado - it had one tiny sliver of avocado  This place has really hit the dumps.  Never again.,0,negative
"You walk in this joint and think you are going to have to wait forever as it is not a very big place, but probably because the service is quick and food comes out fast the turn over is not as long as it looks.  The skillet breakfasts are the best.  I had the veggie skillet and got it over tomatoes rather than the potatoes and it was great.  Enjoy!",1,positive
"I waited over a half an hour to get my sandwich after ordering, I knew it would be a wait going during lunch on a weekday. It's worth the wait if you have the time!!",1,positive
"Make sure your phone has a good charge for the wait in line, but the sandwiches are pretty on point.",1,positive
"The wait was too long. I think any local such as I, will agree that bachi burger is way better and way cheaper as far as fancy burgers go that is. Food isnt bad but just not worth the money and the experience.",0,negative
Waited 10-15 minutes - got no service from any of the 6 waitresses that walked by multiple times or the one that was sitting at the next table.\n\nBeen here a few times and the service was never great but getting no service at all was a first.\n\nNot going back.,0,negative
"This is a little mom and pop place, the food is all made from scratch.  The wait was 45 minutes to get a table, and it was worth it!  Everything was excellent, and even my kids cleaned their plates, which, to my memory, has NEVER happened before.",1,positive
It took an hour and a half to get seated. A family that couldn't bother to read their coupon was give a free meal and priority seating because they were causing a scene and the food s not really that great. I would avoid it at all costs.,0,negative
I got take out and while the wait was only about 10 miNs that was the best part I ordered a large but when I got seems like a spall know maybe I'm spoiled from being in Brooklyn New York where for supercheap And it for days. This experience is one of the worst I've had in town the food was beyond boy and and mediocre of course I did get pad Thai But the veggies were old shriveled and disgusting I did not enjoy this experience at ally,0,negative
"We had to wait about 30 minutes to get seated but once we were seated the service was amazing from start to finish! The onion ring appetizer is so tasty as well as the fried Mac and cheese balls with the tomato bisque dipping sauce. The drinks are amazing as well such as the smores martini, the Swedish fish and the grape crush. We went as a party of ten and we were all satisfied. I had the BBQ chicken pizza and it was heavenly. I would definitely recommend this place and I will definitely go back if I'm ever in vegas!",1,positive
"Made reservations for 9pm and we were seated promptly.  Strangely had to ask for menus. There seemed to be a confusion on who was supposed to wait on our table.  But they took our order quickly and the food arrived in short order.  We ordered the hawaiian ono and lamb chops which were both superb. The only negative was that it took a while to get the check. Must have been because of the Yelp checkin offer (lol). Overall, a great place with excellent food and a great staff.",1,positive
"We have been waiting for 1 hour and 6 minutes, have yet to receive our food!  How is it?  Who knows!  DO NOT go to this place if you have any value of your time!  I ordered at 7:31, we got our order at 8:37!  The business itself closed at 8:30. Very disappointing.\nMeat was dry and Luke warm, Mac n cheese was old & crusty, fries were soft not crunchy. \nAll in all a very disappointing experience : (",0,negative

"We didnt have to wait at all. Big menu, was told its new as of 6 months ago. \nLots of food to choose from almost too much to choose from.\nHuge portion, get ready for doggie bag, left overs are the best.\n\nAt the end shared 30 year celebration cheesecake cause we went to celebrate  our 24 yesrs of marriage .\nClean, fast, friendly staff, . Best part while waiting for food to come, you get bread hot warm, it will fill you up \nAsk gor Jennifer, she was great",1,positive
"The food here, once it arrived, was very good. Well worth the wait, even though the wait was somewhat inexcusable. We got there just behind a large take-out order and waited nearly 30 minutes for food to come up. One wonders why you'd prioritize takeout orders ahead of live customers actually seated in your dining room. I'll gladly eat here again, but if this kind of nonsense happens again I won't be back.",1,positive
"Came here on a Tuesday night. Wait was less than an hour and got in pretty fast. The food this time wasn't as good as my first experience. \n\nThe crabs were so small, the prime rib was extremely salty, and the sashimi was just ok.\n\nThe good part was the cocktail shrimps, they were delicious. The dessert was also very good and our server was amazing. Other than that I hope this is just a one time blip and not something that I've noticed other buffets following the trend of bad quality.",1,positive

"Meh. We arrived at 5:45pm and immediately got a table. Drinks arrived and we placed an order, then we waited, and waited, and waited, asked the waiter where the food was, waited some more, finally got food. This place makes great rolls, but the service isn't consistent. Our order got lost and they apologized, but come on - if the table that was seated 15 minutes after us got food wouldn' t you think to ask where our food was before we mentioned it???",0,negative
Simple breakfast food took about an hour to get to us. When we asked about it our server gave us attitude and rolled his eyes. When the food finally came it was subpar and hashbrowns were cold. Will never go there again and won't recommend. The last thing you want when you're hungover and hungry is bad food/service that takes forever.,0,negative
"Food was so bad my daughter threw up and we all have the runs, the chicken served was more than just pink, not only that but it was ALL very blan. I have had MUCH better... So don't believe all the hype, and so not worth the 1 1/2 hour wait..... This place should be called the stable, because all of the mess and pigs that go there and eat the slop. It was very uncomfortable sitting under the bright lights and witness the mess.... What a disappointment !!!!!!",0,negative

Servers are attentive and friendly. The portions are huge, I've never been able to finish my plate. \n\nMy mom is also a picky eater and orders the corn beefed hash and likes it here. It's hard to find a place where they make it to her liking.",1,positive
I went to get a quick bite to eat at noodles . I ordered the satay chicken $13 for 3.5 pcs .  The wait was around 20 minutes from the time I ordered . I order satay chicken all the time around Las Vegas and for 5pcs it is usually $7-$8 . The most important thing is this was the worst tasting satay chicken I have ever had . The service was fine ... The food was not good and was overpriced !,0,negative
"My daughter and I have been going to Pita Jungle for 8+ years and have loved every single item we've ordered. The service (lack of) has changed over the years as they've grown and become more popular. We often feel rushed or forgotten and have waited as long as 30 minutes to get served on several occasions. BUT, the food is simply great and worth waiting for. Some of our favorites: Chicken Shawarma, grilled chicken pasta salad, grilled vegetable salad, garlic hummus, veggie burger & smoothies. You cannot go wrong.",1,positive
We thought coming by around 2pm would pass the lunch rush but it was still packed. There were 8 of us and we had to wait a while because there weren't any tables available that would fit all of us. \n\nThe food was good; I had like 3 servings of the mac n' cheese and 10 of these little ice cream cones filled with goat cheese. \n\nThey must have been switching to the afternoon/dinner items because 1/3 of the stations were closed and they weren't refilling certain items.,1,positive

Too busy with too much wait time\n\nFood was just ok. This is a classic example of what people perceive as a good place because it was a blind mouse leading another blind mouse\n\nNo it was not worth the wait. Next door brunch is just as good.\n\nIHOP is just as good no kidding.,0,negative

"There was a 45 minute wait, even when there were multiple empty tables. The food wasn't good and for sure wasn't worth the price. Our waiter was TERRIBLE! He spilled coffee on our table and didn't wipe it up, took forever to take our orders and if we asked for anything he rolled his eyes at us. The frozen hot chocolate was OK- definitely not something you need to wait an hour to get. However, I guess it is cool to say that you've tried it.  I will not be going back.",0,negative
Service was quick - but all I had ordered was a sesame bagel with cream cheese. So I should be quick.  All I will say is that they barely put any cream cheese on the bagel!! I had to pull the bagel apart just to see they remembered to put it on!,0,negative
I'm surprised by the low reviews.

"25 minutes to get a shot,22 minutes for my cocktail..70 minutes for a chicken sandwich and pot roast..... The wait was just silly for anything I asked for, it was busy but still plenty of open tables.\n\nFried pickles good but wayyy too salty, Chipotle chicken decent. Fries were obscenely salty and barely edible. Chix quesadilla good but small portion. Margarita was pricey.",0,negative

I called for a take out order on a Sunday at 6:20pm and was told my order would not be ready until 8pm. An hour and 40 minutes to make a pizza and an order of wings? That is absurd. Definitely will not be considering this location on a weekend again.,0,negative

Great food but if there is more than 4 people in front of you it will be an hour wait for food.,0,negative
We have visited this restaurant several times and each time we really enjoyed the food here.  The wait can be long as 45 minutes or longer but worth it.,1,positive
"Ordered over phone. They said 10 mins. I arrived in 15; order not started yet. One girl was restocking chips, and the other one told me she was cleaning up a flood in the back. I understand that things happen, but she wasn't really apologetic, didn't offer a concession or upgrade for me having to wait when my order wasn't even started yet, and it seems the girl that was restocking the chips could've been making my sandwiches while the other girl was cleaning up the so-called flood in the back. I was not a happy camper.",0,negative
Waited an hour for a cold $15 burger when I got back the second time it was warm but not worth waiting for!,0,negative
"45 minutes between clearing appetizers & being served dinner. Extremely disappointed in meal & service. Went here a few times years ago months after it's opening when both food & service were phenomenal. Seems like different place, so we'll be going elsewhere in the future.",0,negative
Nothing Rapido about this place and it's a total rip.  If I'm getting an $8 side salad or a $3 meatless taco I should at least get it in a reasonable amount of time.  Just order carry-out from the restaurant and get the adult portions in half the time for only a few bucks more.,0,negative
"Came here kinda late (9:00pm) waited in line for almost an hour.  There was still a lot of people behind us in line.  Food was good, not exceptional.  But for $45/person, including kids, they should not have taken the food away around 10:00, those poor people behind us in line probably didn't get much food to eat!  Wicked Spoon, Wynn's and others are better, for less!",0,negative
"My wife and I waited 45 minutes, but our order never came.  It was mid-day on a Saturday and the place was not that busy.  The waiter reassured us several times that our order would be coming right up, but it never did. So we left and went to the food court.\n\nAll I can say is go there at your own risk.  Service is horrendous, and they are not honest about the when your food is going to arrive.",0,negative
This is the first time here and they made us wait 20 mins even when the restaurant was almost empty. The food looks good but is tasteless and the quality was very poor. The prices were very expensive  :-/ However the waitress was nice :),0,negative
Went for Breakfast the first time today. Had to wait about 20 minutes to get seated but a reasonable wait for the amount of people they had waiting. Once seated our waitress greeted us promptly had coffee and water within a couple of minutes. They have a very wide selection to choose from and it all sounds great. Our meal took a little while to come out but it was worth the wait. Everything was delicious and if I'm back in Scottsdale I'm coming back.,1,positive
"I decided to give Willalby's a second chance since Lazy Janes had a 30 minute wait for a table. Willalby's was even worse. We got in, ordered, and then we waited an hour for our food. How hard is it to make some eggs and potatoes? The waiter said, \""""Oh, I forgot to tell you we had a wait,\"""" but the place wasn't that busy. Anyway, the food was okay, but definitely not worth an hour wait.",0,negative
Time for fast food and fried chicken.  The line was short and got served promptly.  The skin is always nice and crunchy . The chicken is not overcooked.  They offer good coleslaw and mashed potatoes and  gravy,1,positive
Food took over an hour to come out. Wasn't only our table everyone around us had the same issue. Food just takes way too long to come out not worth coming here avoid,0,negative
Food is good (from previous experience) but efficiency could be better. I waited outside for 20 minutes and ended up with nothing.  Too busy serving people on inside - why have an outside window if preference to those indoors?,0,negative
"Ugh.  Getting a to-go order is such an ordeal at this place.  You can't call in the order (they apparently don't take orders over the phone) AND you have to be seated to even place an order.  If I wanted to wait for a table, I wouldn't be trying to make a to-go order. ANYWAY, so I tried doing all that and was promptly ignored by the wait staff for about 15 minutes.  Lame.. I eventually just left and ordered room service, which may have a long wait, but the prices are comparable AND I can wait in bed.",0,negative
"Might be a good idea if wait wasn't forever.  Waited on line for half an hour, then waited over a half hour for food to be prepared.  Doesn't seem like a fast food concept.  Also food wasn't prepared incorrectly after all that wait.  Verdict - overpriced, underwhelmed - not a happy consumer.",0,negative
My wife ordered the ribs and I ordered a steak not only did we wait for over 30 minutes but then her ribs were cold and my steak was still walking! We had to send it back and after an hour and half we finally got to leave. Will not be going back there,0,negative
My pregnant wife and I just tried to eat here and after we were seated no one decided to actually come by and give us any help. So after close to 20 mins staring at the waiters and waitresses to see if maybe they would decide to come by and do their job we left. If you are in a hurry or hungry I would advise to find another place. I would've give this place zero stars if i could.,0,negative
Took 40mins for my meal to come out horrible !!! Got my buzz before my food ! Horrible but the bartender was really good about it n comp'd out bill! U better sucker,0,negative
"We arrived before lunch crowd... the wait was zero... \n\nWe had the new Chicken - artichoke pizza (thin crust) it was sooo delicious! \n\nWe also had the roasted vegetable salad with asparagus, artichoke, corn sun dried tomatoes and red/yellow peppers... i personally loved the roasted artichoke flavor.. my friend thought the salad was somewhat bland.  The dressing was good. \n\nRaspberry lemonade was a bit sweet for me but good.\nSo I would be going back for sure!",1,positive
"AYFKM?\n\nIf you're ready to wait, and wait, and wait to be seated and then wait, and wait, and wait to be served. And then get a below expectations food, this is your place.\n\nService was kind but the wait is not worth it.\n\nFood was uneventful. \n\nEnough said.",0,negative
The food came out pretty quick not to mention it was in Vegas! We got seated pretty fast and i definitely enjoyed my food ! Would come back here it was a taste of the normal in Vegas!,1,positive
You usually KNOW what you like immediately & why the moment the plate arrives ...Big LOVE for this place.,1,positive
The line took forever which i don't mind figuring my first time there it would be great food.....low and behold the salsa taste like heinz ketchup...my sonoran chicken sandwich was dry and it took forever. The only positive thing I will say about this place is that they did have good service...very friendly....My first toime there will be my last!!!,0,negative
SLOW...SLOW...SLOW.....the food is terrible....think it is straight from sam's club,0,negative
"Went here on a Tuesday around 530p thinking we'd miss the dinner rush. We still waited 45 minutes for our food then an extra 15 minutes for our check. There were people that got there after us that ate, paid and left before we even got our food. The hot links and mac n cheese were so really good but we won't be returning or recommending this place.",0,negative
Took about 30 minutes for us to finally order and it took practically another 45-hour for the food which only took us 15-20 minutes to eat. Got our food before our utensils. Long story short: horrendous service.,0,negative
Waited for 20 for an average breakfast burrito. Average at best. Definitely nothing special about this place.,0,negative
It took forever to get through the line and then to order.  My favorite sandwich is the bacon turkey bravo and my favorite soup is the broccoli cheddar.  When my food was delivered to my table the soup wasnt very warm.  Panera Bread makes me miss Paradise Bakery.  I am accustomed to getting a cookie with my meal but not here at Panera Bread.  Their whole process just seemed very slow and maybe it's because it's a new location with new employees.,0,negative
"We came here during restaurant week. Busy place as expected, but there is NO reason that our food took a whole 45 minutes to arrive. \n\nOur food was also cold. We both had the filet mignon, mine was cooked as medium even though I asked for medium rare. A warm/cold filet mignon is disgusting. Our mashed potatoes were also just barely warm. It seemed that the food runner might have forgotten about our food and it sat there for a bit too long. VERY UNACCEPTABLE for a fine dining place.",0,negative
A yelp disappointment!  This place was no more special than your local Denny's.  Definitely not worth the 45 minute wait.  Save your time and eat elsewhere less crowded.,0,negative
"Ordered to go and they had you wait standing by the reception desk,\ndidn't even offer you to sit down..waited for 1/2 hour standing.\nMy daughter was disappointed for the small burger she ordered.",0,negative
Went there for lunch and it took nearly 2 hours. My salad had hair on it and the curry was too watery.,0,negative
We got seated right away on a busy Sunday morning. Service was great and we always got attention from our waiter. Food came quickly and was great. Hard working waiters!,1,positive
Food was slow and cold when it finally gets to you. Wait staff was slow to take drink and food order. Bread made it to the table 20 minutes after we sat down. Lunch for five adults from start to finish took 90 minutes and it was not very busy on a Thursday! I will not go back again.,0,negative
"They are sooooooooooo slow here. \nDo not come here if you are in a rush or have anything to do for the rest of the night. There were 3 other people in the whole place and it took our food 30 minutes to come out. We ordered 2 cheeseburgers, 30 minutes for 2 cheeseburgers at a place called Cheeseburgers. Had to ask multiple times for the check.",0,negative
"I am at Roka writing this review. Upon entering this restaurant, we were impressed by the decor, music, and door handles. We were on time (even a little early) and notified that they could seat us after a 30 minute wait. We took their offer to sit outside (February) with only a 5 minute wait. Once seated, we were brought empty water glasses, and waited 15 minutes for a server to bring menus. Food review to come shortly.",0,negative
"I've been here twice and each time I've ordered the potato pancakes with sour cream and apple sauce. I've never had to wait more than 5 mins. for a table and food comes out promptly. Servers are attentive and friendly. The portions are huge, I've never been able to finish my plate. \n\nMy mom is also a picky eater and orders the corn beefed hash and likes it here. It's hard to find a place where they make it to her liking.",1,positive
"Went here aroud 11:30am on a Sunday, there was a bit of a wait for the 5 of us. 30 minutes or so, but did not mind.  All of us ordered off the lunch menu and enjoyed our sandwhiches.  I was looking at the breakfast items walking by and will definitely go back to order off the breakfast menu.  They are only open from around 6am-2pm 7 days a week.  So make sure to get there early.",1,positive
"Long wait, but totally worth it. Everything we ate was seasoned perfectly. Price is very reasonable. The sauces are perfect, especially the chimmichuri. \nThe only negatives are 1) the wait and 2) how small and cramped it can get. Think of it like the ultimate food truck. You order your food, then take it to the seating area behind the restaurant. Had to wait about 40 minutes for our food. Probably wouldn't have minded so much, had we been seated and sipping on a brew.",1,positive
Ehh..... Defiantly not the greatest food..\n\nOur wait was a little over 40 min and the food was not that great. I got the California Chicken it was so bland. Seriously no flavor. The green chilis had no kick to them or flavor. I was highly disappointed. The husband got a steak and steamed veggies. He ordered medium rare and It came out well done.... \n\nThis place was just not that great overall. Not a place I plan to come back to when I visit Henderson again.,0,negative
"I have been to this place twice. The first time the service was fairly quick and the food was great. I came two weeks later and ordered two bowls of Pho and it took over 35 minutes to get out food out when people who got here before us got their food which is really annoying. Horrible service, great food.",0,negative
The food came out pretty quick not to mention it was in Vegas! We got seated pretty fast and i definitely enjoyed my food ! Would come back here it was a taste of the normal in Vegas!,1,positive
"Super slowwwww service. It wasn't busy and they were too scared to bring out all the meat at the same time, so that was super annoying. \n\nThere's a two hour limit for dinner and you'll most likely hit it because it takes 20 minutes for your small portions of meat to come out. That's before cook time!\n\n Food is good but definitely not good enough to come back because the service was way too slow.",0,negative
"Not really worth the wait. Food was okay, could of fit the same at IHop. For a place to be called \""""BabyStacks\"""" the Pancakes were less than average. They have a whole menu of different pancake flavored but it's all fluff. Service was okay nothing exceptional. Overpriced for the portion size you get. $10.95 plate came put like a kids menu item.",0,negative
"We were seated fairly quickly, and received drinks shortly after. But then it took almost an hour to receive the food. It was not that busy in there when we first got there, but within 30 minutes the place was packed with people waiting to be seated. Overall the service could have been better but was not the worst experience.",0,negative
"Waited about an hour, and I say it was worth it.  We did have a party of 7, so it took longer for us to get seated.  We started off with the oxtail chili cheese fries which were really good, and the fried egg on top was the kicker.\n\nI got the Miyagi burger, and a couple other people got the crabby patty.  Burgers and service were good.  Will definitely come back when we are in vegas again.",1,positive
The service is a little Slow at the end of the night but it is because the food is fresh. great environment. This is not a place to be in a rush.,1,positive
"Extremely slow. We made a reservation for hibachi and an hour after arriving they have not yet started cooking. The miso soup was good, but their salad came with some chunky orange dressing that didn't taste good.",0,negative
After seeing the reviews on Yelp I decided to try this place one evening and was not disappointed.  Since then I order take out at least once per week.  Even though it is  common to see a line at the door (and sometime outside) it never takes more than 10 minutes for my food to be prepared. I usually get lemon grass chicken or beef (creature of habit) that is as good as any that I have had anywhere else.  The gentlemen at the counter is always pleasant and appears happy to see me once again.,1,positive
Now I remember why I stopped coming here.  It takes FOREVER to get your food.  I realize it's a small kitchen with one guy back there but for 3 orders (2 ahead of me) it shouldn't take 25 mins.  Foods decent but I'll head to Frederico's on Cave Creek any day over this place.,0,negative
LONG wait that really wasn't worth it. I liked the idea of the pretzel bun but it wasn't executed well. Poor service.,0,negative
Lucked out and only waited 5 mins for a table! Guacamole Burger & fries were great! Shake was tasty too! Enjoyed our experience. Food came out fast and hot!,1,positive
Have to love the salad and breadsticks. Was told 15 min wait and was sat in less than 5. Great place to eat!,1,positive
Had a quick take out lunch here. Food was good and ready in a matter of minutes.  I'll be back.,1,positive
"50 minute wait around 5 pm. 90+ min wait for people as we left. All the drawbacks of a French  restaurant - long lines, high prices - with none of the quiet dignity, elegance, or ambience. Typical buffet you could have anywhere, with only a few exceptions (good creme brulee, made to order crepes). If you can eat $30 worth of seafood or creme brulee, this MIGHT be a good deal.",0,negative

The food is awesome but the delay is too long.  We waited 30 minutes from the time we ordered to get three BBQ sandwiches.,0,negative
I'm usually a panera fan but this location is way too busy. I went here yesterday for lunch and he line was out the door. After making it through the agonizing line.... there was a back up at the service counter since they were do busy. Estimated time wasted waiting was approximately 30min... which for a panera is pretty bad.\n\nI may hive this place another shot since the Thai chopped chicken salad was okay. I'll just try to avoid it on weekends or busy lunch dinner hours.,0,negative
"Rediculous!!! Was told there would be a 25 min wait, which was hard with our special need twins, but instead we waited over 45 minutes, meanwhile 2 tops were walking in & being seated, spoke to the \""""manager\"""" who was rude & wasn't willing to put 2 tops together! Needless to say their food might be good but who cares with that wait & attitude, you can get breakfast anywhere!",0,negative

Love this place.  And being kid friendly is a huge plus for us.  We have had the pleasure of eating here several times and have never been disappointed.  Wait staff has always been friendly and pleasant.  We do not  mind waiting on average 20-30 minutes.  It is worth it.  Love this neighborhood cafe.,1,positive

This place is awsome there was a wait of 20 min but it felt more like 5 min. The sage fried chicken is bomb.com it was very much comfort food. I am a big guy and can usually put down a fair amount of food but this is deff something that should be shared with a side of hashbrowns.,1,positive

"It took 22 minutes for a table to open up. There were extremely loud children so there's no ambience.

At least dessert came quickly. Could use less sugar but whatever works. Now I remember why I don't like Olive Garden.",0,negative

"I ordered take out. And it took an hour to get my food even though I ordered French toast and my sister ordered bacon. I don't understand why it took so long.

"I wish I could get in the door to review the food but I do not like waiting and there is always a long wait. at least 30 minutes. \n\nOne day though, I'll get my foot in the door. and the food better be good",0,negative
I was greeted and seated promptly. Ordered special pho combo p1 and it was out in less than 3 minutes hot and delicious. Very impressive! The cigar smell is annoying but they can't do much about that as the neighboring shop is a cigar bar. Price is right. No complaints! I shall return.,1,positive
If you have 45 minutes for them to give your order to someone else and then get upset because you expect a sandwich and a refund then this is definitely your place. The food is good but you have to consider if the hassle is worth it,0,negative
"35 minute wait with lots of open tables. Seriously, there were 5 open tables in the same area they seated us. Good burger. Wifes steak was a pretty bad cut of meat. She loves their sweet potatoes though.",0,negative
"Got here at 8:30 and was done by 9:00 pm.  Great service and great food!  The pad see ew, tum yum soup, pork with basil left and crab fried rice were all scarf down in 30 mins.  The appetizer fish balls and dumpling come out smaller than the pictures but it all tasted good.",1,positive
we waited for about 45 min after ordering... that was the bad part. but it was very very good. we had the sausage thing with the ragu sauce on it.. never had crepe like that before. expensive... but well worth it.,1,positive
There were only four people in the restaurant and we waited over 40 minutes for 2 gyro pitas. Slowest service I have ever encountered.  Unacceptable for a order at the counter type of restaurant.  The food was good but not worth the wait.  The staff did not appologize at all for the slow service or explain the delay. They really need to get their act together or this place will be out of business soon.,0,negative
"It took 34 minutes from the time we ordered to the time we received 5 small shakes.  And when the girl arrived at the car, she didn't know which shake was which.",0,negative
We went here tonight and we didn't have to wait. There was a lot to choose from but unfortunately not one thing I ate was any good. I wouldn't  go again.,0,negative
Not sure how good the food is going to be but 45 minutes to get it is unacceptable. No apologies at all from the staff either. Finally got our food. Not worth the wait.  Skip it!,0,negative
"I'm visiting from out of town, due to time change went to this I Hop at 11:00 a.m. For breakfast.  The place was pretty much empty, but it still took them over 30 mins to deliver our food. \n\nIf you like super slow service, bugs in your water, luke warm food, forgetful waitress.  Then you've come to the right place...enjoy!",0,negative
"We literally waited almost an hour for a few sandwiches and a Mexican pizza (which is just a tortilla with stuff thrown on and warmed up, nothing hard).  We never got an update on our order although the waitress was very sweet but she was the only person running the dining area and clearly running around. If you don't have time to waste (which we didn't) I would not recommend eating here. Food is just ok, nothing to write home about.",0,negative
"The food here, once it arrived, was very good. Well worth the wait, even though the wait was somewhat inexcusable. We got there just behind a large take-out order and waited nearly 30 minutes for food to come up. One wonders why you'd prioritize takeout orders ahead of live customers actually seated in your dining room. I'll gladly eat here again, but if this kind of nonsense happens again I won't be back.",1,positive
"We wait FOREVER for our food every time we come here, no matter what time of day, even if it's a take/out order. However, I love Denny's and their food but aim for a different location!",0,negative
"Our table received two cold breakfasts after a 45 minute wait and a hot order of chicken fingers. The chicken strips were tiny, the plate was 95% fries. Mediocre food but the waitress was great. She got one of the cold breakfasts taken off the bill for us as well.",0,negative
"Came here for breakfast on a Saturday. We got a table right away, that was the only fast thing about our meal. We waited probably close to an hour for our breakfast. I gobbled my meal up not because it was amazing but after that long wait- I was starving. In addition, the runner spilled the syrup on the pancakes and said he would be right back with fresh ones but never came back. The coffee was not tasty. I suggest you visit the host of other breakfast places in LV besides here.",0,negative
"There was a wait at lunch, about 25 minutes give or take, definitely doable, though unnecessary because they had tons of tables. I guess they think that's acceptable to people so they don't pay for more waiters. The food was excellent and great quantity of choices. Very satisfied.",1,positive
"Horrid! Two hours!!! It took two hours from the time we sat down to get drinks, food, and our check-ridiculous!  If wasn't a leisure two hours, it was craning our necks-looking for our waitress, wondering if our food would ever come.  I don't know if they were just understaffed or what, but I had to go looking for my own fork :(\nWe ordered oysters Rockefeller, which were cold and tasteless. The lobster boil was no bueno the lobster was tough!\nNever again!",0,negative
40min for a sandwich to be delivered not mind blowing like the radio said. I order here multiple times takes at least 40 to 50 min. Kinda sad. Sandwiches are good because you have to wait for so long you get hungrier.,0,negative
"Waited 2 full hours till our order came to us.. LITERALLY 2 hours. Food was okay but not great. Waiter and waitress are fine but what a lousy excuse they had.. \""""We ran out of hamburger buns\"""" then... \""""Your first waiter put in the order but we somehow lost the order\""""",0,negative
SLOW...SLOW...SLOW.....the food is terrible....think it is straight from sam's club,0,negative
It's basically not worth the long waiting. It took me almost 90 min to get a table. The quality of food is less than average.,0,negative
Came in at 12 noon. Not very busy but its a Thursday so I don't expect it to be too busy. Ordered the albacore tuna melt. The tuna melt is very heavy handed with relish but light on cheese and Mayo so that was a bit dissatisfying and the lemonade was chalky so I will not be giving more than an average rating.,0,negative
It took over 45 minutes for them to to seat us. We ordered the calamari As our appetizer and when it arrived it was substandard and did not taste very good. When our entr\u00e9es arrived they were cooked however the seasoning was lacking and the food itself tasted like something I could make it home. The staff was relatively attentive however for the price and the wait time was far below my expectations. I was reminded why I had not been to a red lobster in three years and won't be returning anytime soon.,0,negative
The wait here was really long and our waitress seemed uninterested and annoyed. But the food and drinks were great. Chicken was a bit dry but the lobster was surprisingly good and sweet.,0,negative
I waited 30mins. to be seated for dinner and boy was it worth the wait.  The food was delicious and soooo many choices!!  The best part was the crepe station and the desserts.  The waiters were very attentive andthe price for the buffet was reasonable.,1,positive
"Waited about an hour, and I say it was worth it.  We did have a party of 7, so it took longer for us to get seated.  We started off with the oxtail chili cheese fries which were really good, and the fried egg on top was the kicker.\n\nI got the Miyagi burger, and a couple other people got the crabby patty.  Burgers and service were good.  Will definitely come back when we are in vegas again.",1,positive
Waited 20 min to be seated. Had terrible service and almost left. The pizza was ok and I was not much of a fan of the beer. My wife had it in Ohio and loved it but she said this BJ's was not nearly as good. Hard to find parking at this mall.,0,negative
"I decided to give Willalby's a second chance since Lazy Janes had a 30 minute wait for a table. Willalby's was even worse. We got in, ordered, and then we waited an hour for our food. How hard is it to make some eggs and potatoes? The waiter said, \""""Oh, I forgot to tell you we had a wait,\"""" but the place wasn't that busy. Anyway, the food was okay, but definitely not worth an hour wait.",0,negative
Great food at first service seems speedy but then lags during serving but the good made up for it!!!!,1,positive
Food was slow and cold when it finally gets to you. Wait staff was slow to take drink and food order. Bread made it to the table 20 minutes after we sat down. Lunch for five adults from start to finish took 90 minutes and it was not very busy on a Thursday! I will not go back again.,0,negative
"went here with my bf and his friend. came in at 7pm. took 10 minutes for someone to even realize we walked in the door..then took about 35 min to even get our food. they didn't seem very friendly. luckily, the food is pretty good [i've eaten indian food in europe before and it almost stood up to that.] i just didn't care for how slow they were.",0,negative
30 minutes for a pizza and wings. I walked in and he said 15. \n\nThey were arguing in the back as well. Very unprofessional and very loud and does not make me interested in coming back. \n\nI would not have ordered food from here if it took this long.  \n\nWould not recommend at all. Especially for pick up on store.,0,negative
"First time trying this place and arrived on a Sunday at noon. We Were the first table in and were greeted immediately. Menu is simple and easy to choose from. We ordered three rolls a fantastic, Vegas and shrimp lovers.\nRolls arrived quickly. Oh my goodness so good! We finished off all three in 15 minutes. Will certainly be back.  Delicious!",1,positive
I agree with the others that this particular chick Fil a is Slowwww! The drive thru takes a while. Food is ok but the waffle fries are not as crispy as they should be I'm kinda disappointed! They only gave me a little bit of chicken on my salad too. \nI've had better in other locations.,0,negative
Soooooo slow! Took over 20 minutes for to go order. Three people working as one. Had over 7 orders stacked up. Took there sweet time. Worst fast food experience ever.,0,negative
The food came out pretty quick not to mention it was in Vegas! We got seated pretty fast and i definitely enjoyed my food ! Would come back here it was a taste of the normal in Vegas!,1,positive
We came here on a Monday around 11am. We were seated and received our food quite fast. #77 on the menu was amazing and full of flavor. We got the crunchy spring rolls and those did not dissapoint :),1,positive
"Sooooo overrated.  I've been here three times now and this last time will be my last.  I don't mind a wait if the food and experience are worth it, but when you finally get seated at a teeny table with  not enough room for the plate, coffee cup and flatware and then the menu is limited to Denny's fare and just a hair above their quality....well, just go to Denny's.  I haven't been to Denny's in ten years; it will be longer than that before I go back to Matt's Big Breakfast.  Not a fan of greasy food.",0,negative
I'm convinced that the hostess says their is a 45 minute wait no matter what. Unless there is an two hour wait. Get your name on the list early. The chicken wings are a great way to start and the pad thai is solid. Dial back your usual spice number. Don't go higher than a 5 unless you are a crazy person. Service is typically solid.,1,positive
"My first time there with the family two weeks ago. There were five of us in one small table next to the restroom. We waited for an hour and only ice water came out. Seriously, how long does it take for the cook to make 5 bowls of pho??? The worse part was that the waiter didn't even try to come by and let us know that they're way behind. Unacceptable! I will tell all of my friends and other family member not to come to this place. We went to Kim Long and the wait were well worth it!",0,negative
I very rarely give one star reviews but this place is taking forever. \n\nit's been 25 minutes from one hamburger!!!,0,negative
"We were seated promptly, but waited 10 to 15 minutes before flagging down someone and asked her if she could send our wait person over. It turned out she ended up taking our table. She was ok-not super fast or overly friendly but efficient enough. The food was average- compared to some of the other PF Changs I've been to.  The  vegetables were tough and the overall quality was just not there. I'll go back to PF Changs, but not this one. It took forever to pay too-very annoying.",0,negative
"a one hour wait on a thursday around 845? not cool. then having TERRIBLE service because it's close to closing time, definitely not ok. foods OK. (i like their sanwhiches/pasta, but pizza is average.) not worth the wait.",0,negative
Food is good (from previous experience) but efficiency could be better. I waited outside for 20 minutes and ended up with nothing.  Too busy serving people on inside - why have an outside window if preference to those indoors?,0,negative
"I always get amazing food here. Never fails, the wait is usually kinda long maybe like 45 min. but its a good thing because thats how popular they are in our are. Their service is amazing and so are the breadsticks. We actually had them cater our wedding. They are the best in the area.",1,positive
This is the first time here and they made us wait 20 mins even when the restaurant was almost empty. The food looks good but is tasteless and the quality was very poor. The prices were very expensive  :-/ However the waitress was nice :),0,negative
35 minutes... No food. You be the judge.,0,negative
"The food is great. The wait is insane. I ordered online, they said it would be 20 minutes, it was 50 minutes. For three meals. Are they catching the fish?! Then they tell me that I'm having to wait because they had to fill a catering order. Well don't I feel special.",0,negative
Went on a Saturday afternoon because you can take the dog and sit outside. 15 minutes from receiving a menu to ordering. 30 minutes to get 2 salads and 2 burgers which were lukewarm. Another 15 minutes just to settle the bill. I don't know if it is lack of staff or ll bad management but a quick bite to eat took over 2 hours. I will not be returning.,0,negative
Food is ok..\nService is slow..\nWaitresses need to figure out which order belongs to who..\nThey're nice.. But people come here to eat not to make friends with them..\nSeriously speed up the process..\nYou can't have one person wait 40-50 minutes for one order!!,0,negative
Literally waited an hour and half to get service. Food was decent but not for $50 a plate. Very dissapointed,0,negative
"Not worth the wait.  Took 1.5 hours to get our food and they still managed to forget the clam chowder.  The cook was just complaining the whole time about working a 10 hour shift.  Everyone has worked a 10 hour shift before, but the customers don't need the attitude.  Lousy food, lousy service, lousy casino.",0,negative
"Waited 30 min for my meal. Ordered the chicken fried steak. Came out to me cold, questionable whether or not there was actually meat in there since it was so thin all I tasted was fried batter. Toast was so cold my butter didn't even melt. Boyfriend got the surf and turf omelet which to no surprise was also cold, along with his English muffin. Service wasn't all that great either. Too bad...definitely will not be returning or suggesting anyone else go either.",0,negative
"Came in for lunch, it took 15 minutes just to be able to place our order. (Mind you this is our lunch break). Even though the cheeseburger sliders were the same price as the pulled pork sliders they would not do one of each style on a plate, that just couldn't be done. Then it took 25 minutes to get our food. I was not impressed by the service and disappointed by their lack of flexibility in changing up my order so I could try two of their menu items. I don't think I'll be back.",0,negative
"I have been to this place twice. The first time the service was fairly quick and the food was great. I came two weeks later and ordered two bowls of Pho and it took over 35 minutes to get out food out when people who got here before us got their food which is really annoying. Horrible service, great food.",0,negative
"The restaurant was very slow at clearing tables and seating people. At one point, there were 5 different tables open and a 30-40 minute wait. Once you are seated the food was quick to come. The food was ok, but not worth a long and unorganized wait.",0,negative
The wait is ridiculous....I have no patience...and it's just a sandwich...I'm not waiting more than an hour....so low and behold- next door is take out! You get to wait there too...but much faster. Meats are delicious. You MUST go here when you visit Montreal...every time :),1,positive
"ok so sometimes the wait is crazy long, it's worth the wait. The only restaurant that we will wait it out..the food is great..it's just awesome every time",1,positive
I went here with a friend on a Sunday at around 9:00 or 10:00 am since there was only 2 of us we only waited about 10 minutes. I ordered the wolf pack.... It was really good! The service was fast & friendly. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't serve coke products :( but other than that I really enjoyed the experience!,1,positive
Here after church for friends bday. The wait time was not bad for a party of 6 and baby. 3 out of the 6 people enjoyed their meals. But this is my review and unfortunately I was one of the not happy customers. I ordered a simple turkey club. It was brought out missing the bacon and the bread wasn't toasted either...so I had a bland turkey sandwich for 11 bucks? Not a good experience. I am sure other options would have been better but this item will be off my radar from now on.,0,negative
We waited for about an hour for a table.  It was well worth the wait!  The pizza and calzone were amazing.  Maria was a fantastic server!  We will definitely be back and bring others with us!,1,positive
The wait was forever but the food was terrific. Can't wait to try it again.  Their bacon was fabulous and I had a very interesting omlette flavor combination.,1,positive
We did not have to wait and got right in which was good.Service was good and friendly even got me the drink I asked for that was not on their list.\n\nFOOD\nAwful not like it used to be at all\nCrab legs still tasted frozen and no meat inside\nSushi don't even try\nMussels awful and dry\n\nDuck and charcuterie was ok but not worth $40 each.\n\nHubby hated his lamb chops and could not eat them as smelled like burned rubber\n\nWon't come back too much hype for nothing at a high price!!!,0,negative
Never go here late. Got into town wanted some food and if I only sat here for over a half hour before anyone came and even gave me a menu and talk about a shitty attitude. The crack head that took our order could have not gotten everything more wrong! Avoid this place at all costs!,0,negative
"The wait is LOOONG, but the food pays for itself. I ordered \""""2 carnitas tacos\"""" and one \""""carne asada torta\"""" on a Sun. afternoon, and I waited 30 minutes. I should have brought a book, to go along the wait, but just forgot this time! Anyway, the food is always delicious and that is how I am able to keep my mouth shut by not complaining over the long wait. If you don't mind waiting for good food, go to this place. It will be worth it!",1,positive
"Oh my gosh, this place is amazing!  I went for lunch & I'm upset I only got a half!  Yes it's busy & you may have to wait a moment for your food.  However, they state that right on the door when you walk in.  I went right around 2pm & only waited about 5/10 minutes before I was on my way home with my delicious food! Hands down amazing sandwhich (ham, turkey, & cheese) & those pickles they have are amazing!  Great prices too.. I WILL BE BACK.. maybe tomorrow?",1,positive
"Waited over 35 mins from the time we ordered our drinks until they brought them to us. Granted it was busy, but that's inexcusable for the amount you pay here. The waitress was really nice and apologetic but seemed as if she was helpless to fix the situation. \n\nThe food is actually really good. If they lowered their prices by 20% their prices would be more in line with the quality.",0,negative
"wait was longer than I would prefer, but then again it was a Saturday night. like everyone else said... portobello mushrooms were yum x10! tri tip was delicious. very friendly staff although the bus boy did spill sauce on my purse while clearing the table. a little annoyed but.... accidents happen?",1,positive
"Always on the slow side. I'd agree with Sott W. - they just don't seen to figure out how to make it work. They are busy, but not effective at all. It can take quite a while to get your food.",0,negative

"Conveniently located across from Firesky Resort- I was able to walk over and place my order.  I didn't call ahead, but it took approximately ten minutes to get my chicken flatbread.  It was sooo yummy and not too heavy.  I reccommend that as an entree!",1,positive

"At the Las Vegas Foodie Festival I waited 3 hours for White Castle, an hour for White Rabbit and another hour for a sushi burrito... And they all didn't compare to The Big Easy Balls from Sauced!

"Within 8mins the salad & soup came.  I have curry peanut salad, it's good. 12 minutes for entree, I ordered tofu chili mint, ...awesome!! Taste like home!. I would like to come back again!",1,positive
"Walked in and was told there was a two hour wait. Walked out got on yelp and made a reservation that got us in in only 30 minutes. Gotta love yelp reservations. The girl at the front desk looked quite surprised when we came back in 30 minutes and there was a reservation listed. She smirked and sat us.  The service inside was great, our waitress was fantastic the prime rib was beautifully cooked.  Would eat there again for sure.",1,positive
"Expect a long wait during breakfast/brunch hours with poor service. The food was fantastic, but we waited 30 minutes to be seated and then another 20 to get our food after it was ordered. They brought out of meals for the three of us piece by piece, where more than one our plates were cold. Even still, the food was good.",0,negative
Our wait time was only about 20 min for the place being completely packed. Our server was super helpful and our food came incredibly fast! It was super delicious and reasonable priced.,1,positive
what a long wait...was it worth it? is anything ever worth the wait? heeeheee..i saved our seat for so long that i actually got up and gave it to the couple standing around with their crepes in tray. i felt so bad that they were just standing and couldn't eat. \nget the proscuitto with the cheese and basil! soo delicious!! that's it.,1,positive

We waited two hours for our dinner.  They did not care! And even when we got our food it wasn't made to our taste. The waiters were running around like they didn't know what they were doing. I would never go there... Unless you want to starve.,0,negative

The line took forever which i don't mind figuring my first time there it would be great food.....low and behold the salsa taste like heinz ketchup...my sonoran chicken sandwich was dry and it took forever.

"Didn't like the waiting initially. That is, AFTER taking an appointment!\n\nBUT THEN\nLove the grilled fish here!\nGreat place, great ambience.",1,positive
Great selection of food. Had to wait about an hour in line though...,1,positive
Waited over 20 minutes after ordering. Had to pester the girl at the pickup counter several times before she looked at my ticket and gave me a stale sandwich that had been sitting out for 10 minutes. No apology for screwing up the order. I was so hungry that I ate most of the sandwich before realizing it wasn't the sandwich I ordered and had mushrooms on it. I recommend avoiding this place if you have food allergies or have less than 45 min to order and eat.,0,negative
"The cheesesteaks are very good but an hour to wait for a sandwich is just way too much. Also, there was no warning of how long the wait would be, and every time we asked how much longer, we were told 15 more minutes. It is too bad, nice family business, just not run effectively.",0,negative
Can't review this place as I walked in and was told a 45 minute wait. I am sure the food must be good but I honestly won't wait 45 minutes for anything to eat. No matter how good something is there always is another option...this time it was Feast Buffet at Santa Fe.,0,negative
"We went there Jan 2,2013.  After a very long wait, almost two hours, we were seated. Then we realized we had more lines to wait in. 20 minutes every time we wanted seafood,  thirty for meat. There were four of us and rarely were we at our table together.  Food was not that great. Would not go back.",0,negative
"It took forever to get the good delivered! \n\nI only ordered 3 dishes but it literally took 2 and half hours.  Me and my roommates were starving to death at home! Here is my advise : do not ever order food from this restaurant! Otherwise  you will feel the pain of waiting your dinner to death.. Also their dishes are cold and nasty!!\n\nGood luck running the restaurant, and not sure how long this restaurant could last.",0,negative
"Slow, slow, slow. Awesome food- can't say the same for the service. We waited 25 minutes for shakes.... not acceptable. Burgers were so good (especially the quinoa) that we'll probably be back. Hoping for an improvement next time.",0,negative

We waited for a long time to be approached by the server. The kid giving chips ended up taking our drink order & then we waited a long time again to get them & then waited another half hour for the food.  The people were all very nice but the food was bland & not good.  I will never come back to this place again.,0,negative
"Food was ok. Not worth the wait. Two of the people on my table got their food 20 mins before the rest of us did so while my brother and i waited for out food my mom and bf were basically done with their food. In my opinion all of the food should come all at the same time, not at 20 minute intervals. I won't be coming back.",0,negative
"We went there for my birthday.  We were greeted OK, as it was busy we waited about 10 minutes,  no problem there.  I ordered a 12 oz ribey rare.  Meals took about another 15 minutes.  My ribeye was cooked correctly, however it was very tough, full of gristle.  Flavor was good,  I wonder the grade of steaks they serve.",0,negative
I'm usually a panera fan but this location is way too busy. I went here yesterday for lunch and he line was out the door. After making it through the agonizing line.... there was a back up at the service counter since they were do busy. Estimated time wasted waiting was approximately 30min... which for a panera is pretty bad.\n\nI may hive this place another shot since the Thai chopped chicken salad was okay. I'll just try to avoid it on weekends or busy lunch dinner hours.,0,negative

"Went in here to try my very first acai bowl! There was no one in line (around 5pm) but a few people that seemed like they were waiting for their orders in the store.

"Came here on a Tuesday night. Wait was less than an hour and got in pretty fast. The food this time wasn't as good as my first experience. \n\nThe crabs were so small, the prime rib was extremely salty, and the sashimi was just ok.\n\nThe good part was the cocktail shrimps, they were delicious. The dessert was also very good and our server was amazing. Other than that I hope this is just a one time blip and not something that I've noticed other buffets following the trend of bad quality.",1,positive
Love this place.  And being kid friendly is a huge plus for us.  We have had the pleasure of eating here several times and have never been disappointed.  Wait staff has always been friendly and pleasant.  We do not  mind waiting on average 20-30 minutes.  It is worth it.  Love this neighborhood cafe.,1,positive
VERY DISAPPOINTING. Waited for 15-20 minutes for a table despite empty tables everywhere. Order was taken and 40 minutes later they brought out our food and BOTH orders were WRONG. Sad.,0,negative
"Might be a good idea if wait wasn't forever.  Waited on line for half an hour, then waited over a half hour for food to be prepared.  Doesn't seem like a fast food concept.  Also food wasn't prepared incorrectly after all that wait.  Verdict - overpriced, underwhelmed - not a happy consumer.",0,negative
I waited for 2-3 hours awhile back because everyone was raving about this place.. I had the pork chop but it wasn't anything special. Maybe I was just tired from waiting so long. I didn't get what was so special about the place. But I will try it again and maybe find the magic in it.,0,negative
"My wife and I left this evening (Cinco de Mayo) without being served or approached 15 minutes after seating ourselves in the bar. When we got up to leave the manager/bar tender asked where we were going, and when I told her wasn't any staff to wait on us on this usually bust night in Mexican restauarants she said ahe didn't have time for any complaints...totally non-professional.\nNeedless to say, we won't return in the future.",0,negative

"I lived down the street from Carly's for 5 years and only managed to go there once. That was one salty, miserable biddy at the bar and from what I could see, that's the kind of trick they always like to hire. I am not trying to have an adversarial relationship with someone who is bringing me drink and food. Place reeks of the famous Phoenix snarkiness.... F that!",0,negative
Wow I watched a bar tender call security for a guy that was black out drunk with a friend. He also called to get hookers off his bar talking to the guy blacking out at the bar. I watched the security guards walk by looking at the hookers obviously doing there thing and walk away. So if your drunk and probably want to be taken advantage of by hookers you found it.,0,negative

"CHECK YOUR RECEIPT!!!  My tab was correct ($ 34.86 for 3 drinks), but when the server ran my credit card he entered $ 64.86.  I do not think it was an accident. He avoided me for at least 30 min after bringing me the check.  Finally had to go to the bar to take care of it. \n\nPretentious staff and clientele.  Whatever the DJ was mixing it sounded like middle eastern music...felt like I should have been smoking a hookah.\n\nOn a positive note, my martini was good and unisex bathrooms were clean.",0,negative
"Worst service EVER, ANWHERE!! \n\nWe sat at the bar, 5 minutes later a bartender asks us if we have been helped.. Duh, we don't have any drinks or menus in front of us and you appear to be the only bartender! I order a coke for starters, but get a sprite or something instead. After looking at the menus for two minutes, and waiting another ten I ask for the check, pay the $5.75 for two sodas and leave. \n\nThe bartender looked directly at me at least six times, but ignored us and washed dishes instead.",0,negative

I'm sorry you're about to get off of work but no need to complain when I hand you a credit card because it takes you a little bit longer than cash.

"We had a fantastic evening, until we went to pay/use the restroom and our mostly full beers were cleared, even after asking the bartender to watch our drinks.

"The same tall male bartender that others have complained about, is the same guy who charged me twice.  He scolded me and said I hadn't paid my tab when I knew I already had.  My phone was already dead so I had no way to show him I had already been charged.  I had a few drinks in me so I figured I could've been mistaken at the time so I gave him a different debit card for him to charge and noticed the following day the exact same charge on both debit cards.

"Just waited ten minutes to get service and the bartender went and helped her 'friends' before us and made a point to say she was doing so. We also watched who I think was the manage walk by, look at us, then walk away.  Just visiting from out of town looking for a relaxing spot.  If rather pay three times as much and get better service than be here for their awesomely cheap drinks. Also asked for a food menu and got an eye roll from the bartender.  Isn't personality important in the service industry?",0,negative
"Went to the Chelsea show and stopped by here after, with a drink in hand. Instantly felt the animosity that we already had a drink (even though we absolutely intended to buy more). Finally, went to the bar to order a drink, because the server asked if we wanted another,  and the younger jersey shore-ish bartender barely acknowledged my existence until he asked for my $45+ for 3 shots, not to mention he yelled at a server in front of customers. Obviously, I understand it's Vegas, but at least act like I am a human...",0,negative

"This is the typical hot right now dead in a year bar because of the way they treat customers. The customers that actually pay are looked over for the security guards friends.

My boyfriend and I went to meet up both of his sisters here last night and had the rudest bartender. She must have been having a horrible day but the service industry is definitely not suited for her. This Zipps is a great location but I won't be back after being treated so horribly.

Great Idea - poor execution! Someone needs to look at the systems and food quality then train staff on service and efficiency. Very expensive for lettuce and a few tomatoes. Dressings and marinated chicken kill the nutritional value. It will never last at the rate they are going.,0,negative

I did a spraytan here earlier today and for some add reason it sprays like you have spots everywhere. It is not a fine mist that I expected. I like the idea of spraytan but not the dotted spraytan if you know what I mean. Anyhow the front desk staff was very nice so I gave a 2 star but the actual versaspa is better on Rainbow. I have dark spots everywhere I look like a dalmatian :) I am glad it will fade away in a week.,0,negative

I was in town for a wedding so having the perfect bronze was crucial. My tan lasted for more than a week and faded pretty naturally. The yelp coupon is an amazing deal, but I think even the full price is worth it. Thanks!!!",1,positive
I had my helix pierced here in '08 by Dana. He was awesome and made sure to keep the needle out of my sight when I said I was terrified of them. I'd recommend HTC (and Dana!) for anyone looking to get pierced.,1,positive

"These guys do the most amazing work! If you are ever in Las Vegas looking for a tattoo, big or small you will not be disappointed!",1,positive
"No no NOOOOO! Glass and smoke products are way over priced for crap. Counter girls are extremely uneducated on anything piercing related. The counter girls are rude and bitchy, defiantly full of themselves because they work at \""""at tattoo shop\"""" if you can even call it that. Cheap jewelry for cheap prices, good luck with that!",0,negative
"I was trying to find a custom airbrush tan in scottsdale area before I went on my honeymoon I found Mandy and she did a  fantastic job, the tan was amazing exactly like she said, it went on nicely and lasted. It wasn't orange and didn't go streaky. I would recommend Mandy and her tans they are great. Will certainly be going back thanks!",1,positive
"I really enjoyed the fact that all their beds were standup, as to avoid pressure points that often occur in lay down beds. When I was there the staff was extremely nice, and really helpful, and even offered me a deal, although I was only there for a day so I didn't take them up on the offer. If you're looking for a good, clean, price efficient tanning salon I would definitely recommend Tanmax!",1,positive
"This is the best tattoo shop in Charlotte! Very well priced, and has great energy and atmosphere feeling. Lizzie, is the best artist; she is extremely talented, a total sweetheart, extremely friendly, and just an amazing person.",1,positive
"I'll never go to another tattoo shop again. I love the atmosphere of the shop, the artists are talented and friendly, and management truly cares about their customers.\n\nI've recommended this shop to everyone I know looking for a tattoo shop. Everyone that has gone in already loves it as well.",1,positive
Have a tattoo that is so faded and not dark or clear. A real waste of time and money. Won't go back. People were nice but quality of tattoo was awful.,0,negative
"This tattoo shop is a hidden gem! We stumbled in fairly late night and were pleasantly surprised by Terry and his wife Jennifer. Not only were they very patient, helpful and kind but Terry gave my BF a BAD ASS treble Clef tattoo! This is the place to go for black and grey work, Terry is a master of it... BUT if you're looking to  keep it live in Vegas and just walk-in and get something (as people often do)Go to Bootleg, you WILL NOT regret your tat in the morning, AND you will be treated wonderfully in the process!",1,positive
nice place... but beware they only let you tan every 24 hrs.  which means if you go in at 5pm on thurs. you can not tan again tell 5p fri.  I suppose its their way of saving/making more money off people.  I would tell people to find another place.,0,negative
"I am a huge fan of this place. I think I pay $38 a month for unlimited tanning in a level 2 bed. This includes stand-up and lay down. I like the stand-up, the bed is much more powerful vs. the lay-down. They have a great spray tan booth as well, its heated and isn't cold! I wish the salon was a little less busy around 5PM, but other than that, its great.",1,positive
This shop gives the best fades in town.\nBeen following Shorty all around town. Glad to see he can finally call a shop his own. Prices are great and the staff is very friendly.,1,positive
It took me a long time to find Ray. I wish I would have 12 years earlier because I will never step foot into another tattoo shop EVER!,1,positive
I have been to April 2 times for a spray tan and each time it has turned out fabulous! It doesn't have the smell that other spray tans have and the color is more natural.,1,positive
I was hesitant to spray tan because my past experiences always left me orange and with uneven color that faded off in blotches. I basically had to cover up until it was gone but when I tried Sun Gun I was hooked. The products they use gave me great color for a week and faded perfectly.,1,positive
"For someone artistically challenged, I felt like Picasso over here :) The staff really walks you through step-by-step and makes the painting WAY more manageable than you would ever first expect.  The first alcoholic beverage free doesn't hurt either :) My funky wine bottle painting is hung proudly above our wine rack AND I won a free painting night while there!! Friends and I will be going back for their bottle painting night .... without instruction so let's see if I'm as successful as the first night :)",1,positive
"I recently got my very first airbrush tan ever! I was pretty nervous going in to the appointment since I didn't know what to expect and I knew I would be disrobing in front of a stranger (eeks!). Well, Nadene at Tan Las Vegas put me right at ease. She was so sweet and talked me through the entire process. I ended up with the BEST tan I have ever had in my fair-skinned life! \n\nI will be coming back regularly to Tan Las Vegas and will be recommending them to my Boudoir Photography clientele!",1,positive
"I'm very pleased with my tattoo. This is my 8th tattoo and my first with any color and shading. I've always wanted one as such but wanted to make sure I went to a good place. Zoo was an excellent artist and I'm in love with my tattoo. The place is clean, and all of the staff are friendly. Instead of getting a drunken tattoo on the Strip somewhere, head over to these guys and you'll be happy with the results the next day.",1,positive
"Even though few people have ever heard of Astara (Biogenic Skincare) - this natural/holistic line - used in spas - is terrific.\n\nExpensive but not crazy, and terrific products that really works.\n\nIt truly is like food for the skin.\n\nAwesome!  Try the Golden Flame, Green Papaya and Blue Flam masques.\nI also swear by the antioxidant emulsion.\n\nThe products also happen to smell divine.  (All those essential oils and plant-derived ingredients make them smell so good.)",1,positive
"friendly service, good and even airbrush tan, not orange at all. very pleased.",1,positive
"Completely regret going here. A tattoo that was supposed to mean a lot to me, ended up looking like absolute crap and now I loathe having to see it every day. The more he tried to fix it the more he kept ruining it - he knew he was doing it too. Now I'm in the process of getting the tattoo removed. It should have clicked in my head as soon as I heard that he'd only been tattooing for a year. Definitely go somewhere else!",0,negative
"I am so unbelievably satisfied with the tattoo I got. Nick was absolutely incredible, the guy's brilliant. \n\nService with a smile, super clean, really just an awesome place. I felt comfortable from moment one. There's also a burger king next door, so if you're hungry you can grab food there.\n\n24 hour tattoo parlor that is really fucking good. I'm surprised, happy, and would recommend this place to anybody.",1,positive
absolutely love this place!!!!\ni always had spray tans but this is by far great!!!,1,positive
"Started going here just over a week ago and I have to say I'm very happy with the experience. The staff is informative and helped me pick the best plan for what I needed and the tanning beds works great. I use the level 4 \""""Dr. Muller\"""" bed and already have a nice base tan after going 3 times (4 minutes first time, 6 minutes the 2nd and 3rd.) I've been to other tanning places in the past and it would seem even after 5-6 times there would be no color. Definitely check them out.",1,positive

"I used the VersaSpay Triple dip here for a 30 dollar Groupon Special. I felt that the equipment was outdated as compared to the VersaSpa at the Flamingo store. It was extremely cold as it sprayed. My tan looked even on my chest, back and torso but it left my arms and legs streaky. \n\nToday, I noticed they raised the Groupon special from 30 to 39 dollars for the triple dip. 30 was pushing it, 39 is totally not worth it.",0,negative
"Oh Ann why did it take this long for you to come into my life??! I was told about Phoenix Glow by a friend and thought nothing of it. Fast forward to the best spray tan of my life, good bye spray tan booths! Ann is amazing at making you feel comfortable and knowing exactly what would look good for your skin. Never have I had so many compliments on my tan, I cannot wait to come back!\n\nThanks Ann!!",1,positive
"Love this place. They are reasonably priced. They work off a point system as opposed to other tanning salons where they would do it by purchasing a certain bed level for an allotted time. Pro Tan USA has great lotions, beds, and service as well. Very clean environment -always necessary! All in all, great spot.",1,positive
Great shop! I walked in with ease and Tami was very willing to help me out with my first tattoo. She was great and my tattoo was exactly what I wanted!,1,positive

"I've had spray tans before but was needing one for a last minute trip and could not get an appointment with my normal person - so I tried this place.  When I got home, I noticed that they missed spots, and within a few days it was starting to spot all over my arms and legs - I had to basically scrub the entire thing off to avoid looking ridiculous.  A huge waste of money.  I will not go back here.",0,negative

"Laseraway is amazing! As a woman with permanently tanned skin, I was ecstatic to find a laser place that knows what they are doing! I have had amazing results!!! \n\nThe only reason this is not a 5 star review is that at times the technicians rush through the treatments without marking the area and spots are missed. Other than that, they are great!",1,positive
Pete Vaca is amazing. I love my tattoo and this shop. He made me feel so comfortable! This will definitely be where I go from now on.,1,positive
LOVE THIS PLACE! !! Went to Bluenote to be tattooed by Joey Hamilton. The tattoo is phenomenal. I couldn't have asked for better. The two owners talked to my husband and I like we were old friends. They are the kind of people you're happy you got to meet. Pricing is reasonable if you know nothing and a steal if you understand what a great tattoo is. My piece was completed ahead of schedule and so they worked my husband in too. Even if you just go for the blues music....go.,1,positive
"My wife tried them out and looked really natural, not orange at all. I decided to give it a shot and it was awesome. Lasted me a week and made me look a lot better going to the pool. Definitely will do it again soon. Thanks Pamela!",1,positive
Thank you Fu Tattoo for completely ruining my husbands tattoo. What was once two initials with a heart is now one big blob. If you can't do a touch up on a customer you need to tell them. Awful. I will make sure to add a picture so everyone can see the work you clowns do.,0,negative

I walked in randomly at noon on Monday with a friend of mine, told the guy what I wanted and he had it drawn up in less than 15 minutes and drawn well at that. Although, getting a tattoo isn't always the most pleasant of experiences, this one was a good one. The artist was professional and did and exceptional job and I couldn't be happier with my latest piece and I definately plan on going back for my next one.",1,positive
My wife goes to the one on Charleston and sloan and every week she goes at least twice a week they tell her to go to another location cause they can't get there tanning machine to work and she pays $150 a month wow what a solution so she called corporate and told them and was hung up on now that's class,0,negative

"So good, I'm reviewing AGAIN! After two years of going to Platinum, I continue to refer friends to MJ for two reasons 1) top notch customer service and 2) the best tan solutions I've ever experienced. While I love the one-hour solution (per my first review), my latest obsession is a lighter tan solution that has a golden olive finish that lasts 10 days when you take care of it. I typically go on Thursday after work and it lasts through the end of the following week!",1,positive
Pete Vaca is amazing. I love my tattoo and this shop. He made me feel so comfortable! This will definitely be where I go from now on.,1,positive
I have been to the Tanning room 3 times now and have had an extremely pleasant experience. \n\nThe two younger ladies who are usually there are very helpful and somewhat friendly. Although there is an older gentleman who is not friendly in fact rude. \n\nThe rates are above average but not by much maybe .50 to 1.00 more per session than the competition. \n\nOverall I will probably use the remainder of my sessions and move on.,0,negative
Great place!  Clean and affordable! Tina was so nice!  The spray tan looks great!,1,positive
"This was my first spray tan experience and I chose wisely! They were very professional and made me feel comfortable. I left the color choice in the experts hands and it turned out great! I had a question the following day, sent and email and received a quick response. My only issue was that although it is right on Indian School Road, the store front sign is small, I drove by twice. I will be back...",1,positive
Spent the day with King ruck yesterday. This is the first review I have ever written but was compelled to do so. Had an amazing experience. Tattoos are awesome and felt comfortable and cared for throughout the day. Ruck is a supreme artist and an interesting person to spend some time with. It was like he took us into his home. Very much worth travelling for his tattoos. Thank you for the experience!,1,positive

The tan is uneven now and my hands have about 3 different shades of \""""brown tan\"""" and my elbows are a weird shade of black/brown.  This is horrible, no golden tan here!\n\nDO NOT spend your money on the spray tan booth.  Go somewhere where they spray it on by hand.  I know that's what I'm going to do next time.",0,negative
"Andrea was amazing!  We planned to get a tattoo months out, read good reviews on Showroom and booked appointments with Andrea.  Not only did she completely create the designs we wanted but she's a perfectionist.  She wasn't afraid to adjust the size and make recommendations to create the best art ever.  Both my husband and I were very happy with her ability and personality.  What a nice person!  We felt comfortable and trusted her completely.  It was all worth it!  We would definitely recommend her",1,positive
"Ann is fabulous and Phoenix glow is the BEST!!! My spray tan with her always turns out smooth and last for a good minimum of a week without any crazy blotchy fading.

Going to have to give this tattoo shop a big two thumbs up! \n\nMy artist has been Dawny. I have 4 tattoos from her now. I highly recommend picking her to do your work. She is very easy going and does an awesome job.

I will never return to this dry cleaner. They destroyed 3 of my husband's shirts. One returned to us ripped in half. They did give us a credit so I let it go and gave them another chance.

"Worst dry cleaners in the valley! They lost a pair of pants and then acted as if they did me a favor for finding them. No apology from the manager when I picked them up the next day. Quite frankly for what they charge, one would think they would offer superior customer service and a quicker turn around time than the $2.50 dry cleaners. I will never use Desert Ridge Cleaners again.",0,negative
"I stopped by Pride Cleaners on Saturday and dropped off two suits and two shirts. Ended up costing about $40 which is a little more than I am used to spending, but they did a really great job and my clothes were ready to go on time.\n\nOpen until 6pm on weekdays works for me.",1,positive
Brought several sweaters and a jacket to them to get dry cleaned and I was very disappointed in the job.  I was actually unsure whether they had actually dry cleaned anything and had to take all the clothes to another place.,0,negative

Haven't had to go to a laundromat in years. Found this one via yelp today. They use a prepaid card instead of coins. Nice attendant to help with questions and keep everything clean. Glad to have found it.,1,positive
"My husband and I used the Dry Cleaning Station a few times when we lived in that area. \n\nGreat service.\n\nThe owner once did a special job for us. My daughter needed a prom-style dress cleaned for a charity event. We got it from the thrift store because she only needed to wear it once. \n\nHe went above and beyond to get the dress back to us in time and it looked fantastic, like brand new.",1,positive
"The worst cleaners ever. Moronic and rude women. My comforter was due on tuesday. I go in on wednesday and they tell me to drive to their other store to look into it since they weren't answering the phone. No, I won't. Called late wednesday and they say maybe it will be done on friday... Never again.",0,negative
I was so disappointed with this establishment. Song and dance on the phone then bait and switch when you got there. He wanted to be paid up front but didn't have a scale to weigh my clothes. Most of his machines were broken. Very seedy and undesirable place. Went to West Flamingo Fold and Fluff instead. THEY were gems!!,0,negative
I love sending my fabulous clothes here. \n\nI drop them off at 8:45 and pick them up at 5:30... Life is good when you know you can trust a dry cleaners with your stylish hip clothing... right?! lol\n\nThey get it right and you don't even have to leave your car!!! *thought I would note that b/c I know there are many other lazy people in the world too*,1,positive
"Honestly, I love america for businesses like this. These guys do a phenomenal job at what they do, just amazing. Service is quick, knowledgable and incredibly courteous. they know what they are doing. they are open saturdays. i drive out of my way to go there, and its just  a dry cleaner. also they do all the work on premises, which i think is a good thing.",1,positive
This DryCleaner is cheap and they do an okay job but be sure to check your pockets. I left my I phone there and when I located it by GPS to be at the cleaners the blonde male store clerk repeatedly denied it being there despite my hearing it ring when I called it.\nThanks to the Scottsdale Police dept for following up and finding it thrown in the trash can outside the door of the Cleaners.\nThe Management was not cooperative with me or the Police.,0,negative
"i think this is now operating under the name francis and sons. regardless, you can pay for a better wash, but you'll still only get the basic. then when you go back to ask about the additional services you paid for but didn't get, you'll get glares. save your money, don't go here.",0,negative
"I was forced to buy a new washer and dryer, and I have to tell you I was really happy with the way Rose at this Home Depot made us feel and how quick and easy she made the purchase, as well as the price.

"They are a great cleaners, and just wonderful people! They do great alterations, have had many formal dresses altered, as well as suit jackets and pants. They do original hem on jeans which is awesome! If anyone says anything bad, just give them another chance! I have been going here for 5 years, and never had one problem. \n\nThey are worth it if they are a bit over the price of other cleaners. You pay good money for your clothes, pay a little extra for a great cleaners!\n\nThey will work with you on everything!",1,positive

"The only time i visited the place was a bad experience. The exterior wash wasn't perfect but the worse part came when i went for vacuuming the interior. The blowers just didn't have enough pressure. I had to run it multiple times over the surface. When i took it up with them, they said it was \""""normal\"""". Only in the end i realized that the hose they were using had a cut or two which might have been causing the low pressure hence proving their claim of \""""normal\"""" invalid.",0,negative
I take my husbands dry cleaning here because of the great price. Their quality on dry cleaning is great. I take my husbands business shirts (laundered) elsewhere because I don't believe they come out as well as the dry cleaning does.,1,positive

"Pretty standard crappy laundromat.  About half of the machines are broken, most annoyingly ALL of the double load machines which are the most cost effective for my laundry needs.  AC is marginal, and I am actually pretty sweaty in here.  The driers seem to work well and are pretty cheap",0,negative
"Terrible....we have used this dry cleaner for about a year now and they just ruined a third item.  We only went back this time because they gave us $100 credit for ruining our quilt and when I picked up our items today another one of my husband's shirts was ruined with the same red stain our quilt had only after being dry cleaned. we will never return to Tide, too much money lost.",0,negative
What a joke.  The price to dry clean one men's wool suit was $23?!  Way more than they told me on phone. Maybe it was because I brought in their 50% off coupon?  Regular price across the street is $14.  Don't know the quality of their work but it won't matter with those prices. Too many other options.,0,negative
"I took in 6 garments, two pair of slacks, a silk polo and three dress shirts for dry cleaning.\n\nFirstly, way overpriced; each article is $3.50, even dress shirts.

This place drives me crazy. I went once a couple months back and hated it. The person that asks what kind of wash you want would not stop up selling me. I decided to never go back. Then they put up a sign saying the place was under new management. I went back and it was worse than before. the guy wouldn't quit up selling me. Then the window crack lady jumped on me. Then it took forever to do the wash. I won't be going back...ever!,0,negative

I have been a customer of Mo's for about 15 years now and have followed him from his previous location. I go mostly for clothing alteration and although sometimes it takes a few days longer than predicted it is always worth the wait. I was so glad when he decided to go Green so any time I have something to be cleaned I bring it to Mo. Just thought I would mention that I live about 15 miles from the shop but still make the trip because it is worth it. Mo and his wife are wonderful people.,1,positive

I will never go back to this place!",0,negative
Had them clean my Louis Vuitton canvas handbag and wallet and did a good job. They did an excellent job repairing the straps to my Gucci handbag. The price was affordable (starting at $45 and up) and much cheaper than other dry cleaners and the shoe and upholstery cleaners. Highly recommend for those of you who need luxury handbag cleaning. They do not do them onsite (they use a vendor).,1,positive
"Awesome service! Friendly and smiling staff (which is a rare thing in Vegas).  Extremely good prices for regular button down men's shirts.  Absolutely will use them again, and they gave me some great samples, since I was a first timer! Drive-Thru service was extremely fast and they are the best Dry Cleaners I have ever used!",1,positive
"ALWAYS take my clothes here, the owners are the ones who do the work... they genuinely care about their customers and always remember me by name.  Small businesses need to thrive and I will continue to support this laundromat.  Worth the drive every time.  Very reasonable prices, may work deals with multiple items.

I think they messed it up - can't be sure since it was the first time I took it to the cleaners but I'm not going back.  The cost for pants was about $6 and about $3 for sweaters...",0,negative
"Finally found my favorite dry cleaning store in town.  Price is reasonable, and service is far better than more pricey ones.  They don't ship your clothes to other warehouses.  All the cleaning is done within the store, so it's faster and adds more personal touch.  There are several mom and pops around town, but this one seems to run independently (Lake Mead and Buffalo location).  Love them!",1,positive
Clean very clean present people $2.10 for shirts and I hate doing launder at a mat but if I have to then I will do it hear.  It's worth the extra buck to do it some where thats clean has WiFi a tv for the game and is right next to a bottle shop and a bar. Ok everything is stainless.,1,positive
Do not go here if you want quick service.  I dropped my dry cleaning off on a Wednesday and was told it would be done by Friday.  When I went in on Friday morning he said it was not done yet and wouldn't be done until after 2pm.  Also very over priced.,0,negative
I'm new to the area.  They were nice and the drive through window is convenient.  However- they are terribly expensive!!  And I just relocated here from the East coast.  This was ridiculous.  Every garment has it's own price- and women's blouses are more expensive to clean than men's.  And they only accept Mastercard and Visa unless you pay for the monthly service.  Very shocked at the bill when I went to collect my clothes.  Where are the flat rate cleaners???,0,negative
"I tried to get my dry cleaning done here yesterday but the ridiculous hours at the dry cleaning counter prevented that. I went in because of the great reviews people give this place, only to find that the counter is open from like 3-5 pm on certain days (can't remember all of the details).  I have no idea what their service is like. I had to take my coats to Kim's cleaners because of the inconvenient schedule at Peachy Kleen.",0,negative
"It's a good price and I have no problem with their cleaning.  It's the morning staff that is very rude.  Not a great way to start off your morning.

This cleaners is completely out of line with their pricing. I have used the best cleaners in Los Angeles and they were never this expensive. I was given a 30% discount and it was still almost 9 dollars per shirt. Competitors in the area charge 5/6 range w/o a coupon. If you want to throw away money go right ahead. I will not be using them again.,0,negative
I started going here a few months ago. They had a bag service that worked pretty well. Price was ok. Today they lost everything. I have been sitting here for 20 minutes and there doesn't seem to be anything they can do and they tell me I didn't drop it off.  Now a manger tells me they will do everything they can but they get seven days to find the clothes. Since I didn't inventory my bag it makes it even worse. Why would I goto a cleaner that needs me to inventory my clothes?,0,negative
Soooo expensive.  They come up with arbitrary charges that end up costing an arm and a leg.  They also ripped the seam on one of my shirts in the process of cleaning it.  Would NOT recommend.  There is a $2.25 dry cleaner right down the street on Indian School that I've started going to instead.,0,negative
I just moved in the neighborhood and don't have my laundry room set up yet. I went here to wash my bed sheets and it was a pretty typical laundromat. The woman working was very friendly and helpful (telling me the best machines to use for what I was doing),1,positive

Noone smiles or is welcoming at all! \n\nDO          NOT            GO         TO             DRY         CLEAN           DEPOT!!!!",0,negative
"My girlfriend took her Coach bag to this dry cleaners and when she got it back, it had a tear on the exterior that was as big as a quarter.

I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau and Celebrity Dry Cleaning did not respond to the BBB either.  I highly recommend choosing a different dry cleaner.",0,negative
"Love this place. Whenever I'm back home, I get my dry cleaning done here. Their prices aren't the lowest in town, but this place reaffirms the aphorism: You get what you pay for.

This was my first time using this dry cleaner/wash & fold....I dropped off laundry along with pants that needed minor alterations and dry cleaning.

I went on their website and was able to print out a $4 off coupon and basically got their high end wash for the price of the middle one. \n\nNavigating around this place can be a bit confusing...I couldn't tell where the entrance was and wound up looking like an idiot (not their fault).\n\nOverall, I would return to this location. I'm giving it 4 stars because they forgot to clean my rear view mirror, which had spots on it. I didn't notice until I drove away.",1,positive
"i can't speak for the laundromat, but the dry cleaning there was sub-par. i took in two down-filled winter coats, they took about 4 days. one came back in good shape, the other was wet, with the down filling in clumps. sure, they were polite and quickly took it back to re-do (dry) it for free, but i was coat-less another 3 days in the middle of winter, and that jacket simply does not \""""feel\"""" the same, i.e. seems thinner and colder ever since.",0,negative

"Do not ever use this company!!! I have been without a clothes dryer for over a month now. As I write this review in fact, It is 4 hours past the 4 hour window I was given to wait for the repairman.

The Dog Wash needed the blow dryers cleaned out. Instead of going to an expensive pet place to have them fixed we took them to Baseline Sew - Vac. We had them all back in time for our Valley fever Fund Raiser. They work great. We will probably be going back soon. I highly recommend this business.,1,positive
"I have been going here for a few years now.  Tried it out because of 'green' alternative...(most dry cleaners use a lot of chemicals), but stayed because of the service.  Which is AMAZING!!  That is all have to say.  Very, very, very good customer service.  If they think it took too long, or didn't come out right or whatever...they reduce or waive the fee.  And I have never had a problem with their work quality, they maintain very high standards and to top it all off...They are REALLY NICE!!!",1,positive

They always do a great job cleaning and alterations usually come out well too... and for a great price!

Most of the time though, they are great!  \n\nSee ya there!",1,positive
"WRINKLED\n\nAll i really want from a dry cleaners is a properly pressed shirt bc I firmly think ironing is a very tedious task.

"Their dry cleaning services are average. Three star.\n\nBut ask them to make any kind of fixes - even something as simple as putting a button back on - and you might as well bet it on black, because there's typically less than a 50/50 shot that they'll actually do what you ask for.

Once the  one  year warranty was up and the dryer would continue to break, I was told by the service dept that I was just out of luck even though the repairs never lasted more than three uses on the machine. I would never buy an appliance from this store ever again.",0,negative
"We had service here. It was affordable and have no complaints towards the staff.\nMy comforter came back having a weird smell. Sorry, I don't know how to describe it. I had to drape it over the stairway to air it out because I didn't want to sleep with it. I prefer a different kind of \""""clean\"""" smell called fresh. A different kind of \""""fresh\"""" fresh. I might have to visit a laundromat if the smell still lingers.",0,negative
"I have tried a lot of dry cleaners- good ones are hard to find, and this is a good one. They have $1.35 men's shirts, they do everything on premise and the staff are friendly. I moved about 10 miles from here, and still find myself driving all that way as I havent found anything near my new place that's as good for the money...\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Drop 'em off dirty. Pick 'em up clean.",1,positive
"Got there on Monday night, and their commercial side of their business had all the washers and dryers being used by them.  Had to find another laundrymat rather than wait for an hour.",0,negative
"Horrible dry cleaners!!!\nFirst off they take twice as long as any other cleaners in town.  They did an alteration on a suit of mine, I get it home and they didn't even do it!! A week for nothing! And when I take it back they said it would take another week to do!!! Ludicrous!!  Horrible customer service!  Noone smiles or is welcoming at all! \n\nDO          NOT            GO         TO             DRY         CLEAN           DEPOT!!!!",0,negative
Don't go here when you are pressed for time. Getting my car washed in a Wednesday morning took me over 90 minutes and that was even after I asked for a manager. In general I like Danny's over their competitors so this may be a location/mgmt issue. I agree with other customers in the upselling comments but its easy to say no and sometimes you can get a good deal if you are a good negotiator.,0,negative
garbage. ruined my army dress blue uniform for a simple dry cleaning. it's awesome because I'm wearing it for my own wedding this weekend. thanks a lot. --- obviously you don't know how to run your business.,0,negative
"i must be missing something because this place seemed expensive for dry cleaning.  they outsource the dry cleaning and didn't really make recommendations on any of my garmets.  i've gone to cleaners before that will tell me to wash over dry clean or startch, ect.  to top it all off the place didn't have my garmets back the day they said they would.  so, i had to make another trip across town to pick them up.  where are the $1.95 per garmet dry cleaning shops in pittsburgh?  this place is out of my dry cleaning budget!",0,negative
"The ladies who run this cleaners are so friendly, I trust them with our dry cleaning and alterations.  They always do a great job cleaning and alterations usually come out well too... and for a great price!  Only thing is if something you're having cleaned or altered has more than one thing that's needs attention, you need to be very specific and point it out more than once.  Most of the time though, they are great!  \n\nSee ya there!",1,positive
I took my husband's shirts to be pressed and cleaned and they came back with more wrinkles than they originally had. They are also more expensive than most places in the area. Their only advantage is the drive thru.,0,negative
"During the week, the staff is always super friendly & helpful. It's always very clean too. For a standard wash it will cost $1.25/load and $0.25 for 8min of dry time. There is also a place next door to grab a quick drink & chill at the bar while you wait for your laundry. I think that's an added bonus.",1,positive
I went to their satellite location at 2020 Ardmore Blvd. in Forest Hills.  I took in 4 dress shirts to be pressed only.  I'm not happy.  The shirts barely look pressed.  The collars are absolutely smashed with no noticeable starch which I requested.  Smashed as if they sat a large hot brick on them and not an iron.  NO creases in the arms?  Very disappointed.  It was under $8 for the 4 shirts but what's the difference with doing such a poor job.  Take your dry cleaning elsewhere.,0,negative
"I've done my laundry at least 2 or 3 times now at Wash Tub and have had no problems.  Plenty of machines, an attendant that will break bills, and a coin dispenser.  However, there's no wifi here which seems utterly ridiculous in this day.  And not much to do in this parking lot while you're waiting, though there IS a video poker bar or two.",1,positive
"Great prices, friendly staff & great management as I've had to use them in the past! I travel from Henderson to get my car washed here! Hopefully soon they will open a location in Henderson!",1,positive
"Cheap, crappy clothes wear once don't wash and throw away. Better off shopping at the dollar store.",0,negative
"The worst dry cleaners!!!\n\nI tried this place because it was close to my work - what a mistake! They took a brand new pair of $85 dark gray dress pants and turned them pink all over the knees and legs. They said that it was sun damage and they would try their best to remove the pink stains. I explained to them the pants were brand new and they still argued with me. They tried to remove the stains, but they did not come out.  They did NOT replace my pants either and now I'm out $85.",0,negative
"Possibly loosing my business. They charged me way too much to clean shorts, just cents less than cleaning pants. Then they charged me extra because 2 shirts had to be hand pressed....why not call me and ask me? The boys upfront were clueless, and one handed me a price list and walked away, which I found insulting. I don't mind paying for services, I've been with Lapels for a while now. Just kind of ridiculous to have a $40 dry clean bill for probably $25 worth of clothes. Will be looking around.",0,negative
"This place pretty much sucked. It took forever and when our tanker cane out it still had soap all over it. It looked bettet when we came in. One gentleman out of tg e 10 that were working tried to make it righr...not a manager. The chrome shop was cool...if we had a Century I could have had anything under the sun, but we drive a Cascadia. Tge ladies inside were very nice and accommodating however, with a Blue Beacon next store...we will never come back to Danny's for a wash.",0,negative
"Thank you Brad and Family, I have been coming here for about 1 year and have had nothing but great experiences! \n\nEvery time I enter organic cleaners I am greeted with a smile. My clothes have turned out, well, better looking than when I first bought them. Mr. Brad K. is the owner and is a great man. He takes his business to a new level that I believe all dry cleaners should go (but then he would have some competition). \n\nGreat work Brad, I will see you soon!",1,positive
Excellent service very friendly people might close never looked better thanks sunset drycleaner,1,positive
"1/2 of the washers and dryers were broken down and not operating. Several people including myself were waiting  for one of the few operating machines. The managers were really nice and helpful, but I won;t be back.",0,negative
"Overall I thought they did a pretty bang up job. I went on their website and was able to print out a $4 off coupon and basically got their high end wash for the price of the middle one. \n\nNavigating around this place can be a bit confusing...I couldn't tell where the entrance was and wound up looking like an idiot (not their fault).\n\nOverall, I would return to this location. I'm giving it 4 stars because they forgot to clean my rear view mirror, which had spots on it. I didn't notice until I drove away.",1,positive
"I have been going here for a few years now.  Tried it out because of 'green' alternative...(most dry cleaners use a lot of chemicals), but stayed because of the service.  Which is AMAZING!!  That is all have to say.  Very, very, very good customer service.  If they think it took too long, or didn't come out right or whatever...they reduce or waive the fee.  And I have never had a problem with their work quality, they maintain very high standards and to top it all off...They are REALLY NICE!!!",1,positive
Asked what the price would be for 4 dry cleaned shirts when i dropped off. Told it was 6.15 per shirt. I said that seemed very high. When picked up  they charged me 31.00. Outragous for 4 short sleeve mens shirts. I won't go back.,0,negative
"I have been taking my husband's shirts to be laundered here for several months.  Over the course of those months, three times the shirts were not ready on the agreed upon date and the excuse was always the machine broke.  I finally had enough and told them they had lost my business.  They did not try and save it.",0,negative
"Terrible....we have used this dry cleaner for about a year now and they just ruined a third item.  We only went back this time because they gave us $100 credit for ruining our quilt and when I picked up our items today another one of my husband's shirts was ruined with the same red stain our quilt had only after being dry cleaned. we will never return to Tide, too much money lost.",0,negative
"Crappy washes, crappy detail service that I was stupid enough to purchase.  What else can I say!  They are really slow if it is the least bit busy.  That's about it.",0,negative
Best dry cleaners in Charlotte!,1,positive
"$22 a month for unlimited washes, vacuum use and air fresheners just can't be beat. And if you smile back at the friendly staff, they usually throw in an extra air freshener.",1,positive
"They do not sterilize the tools between customer uses. The technician lied to me when I asked: \""""Did you sterilize that?\"""" He said yes, then I watched him 're-sterilize' right in front of me. He cut my cuticles so low they started bleeding. If you go to this place you're going to get an infectious disease.",0,negative
This could be the best cleaner in all of arizona.  They can get any spot out.  I had a shirt that had a spot from a year ago they got it out. I had another shirt that a different cleaner gave back to me with a spot and they got it out.  really decent prices also.,1,positive
"there were only about 5 dryers that we're not broken available for use by customers, the rest of the working ones were for staff use only.  When I was in a line of people waiting to utilize the working dryers one of the staff ladies allowed a gentleman to cut ahead of all of us and use the staff dryers which I thought was kind of annoying.  After I was finally able to use a dryer it ate my quarters, the solution to this was the staff member beating the machine with a hammer.  Overall I think this place is terrible.",0,negative
"Absolutely unbelievable dry cleaners! This business understands customer service and exemplifies it with every interaction. Lee is phenominal. Pretty sure this is the type of business that like a dentist, when you move elsewhere you just have to go back... you know what I mean. I'll be 45, unemployed, living in Philly and still flying to PHX to have these guys clean my clothes.",1,positive
"Best dry cleaner around, have been using them for 5+ years and always great service",1,positive
This DryCleaner is cheap and they do an okay job but be sure to check your pockets. I left my I phone there and when I located it by GPS to be at the cleaners the blonde male store clerk repeatedly denied it being there despite my hearing it ring when I called it.\nThanks to the Scottsdale Police dept for following up and finding it thrown in the trash can outside the door of the Cleaners.\nThe Management was not cooperative with me or the Police.,0,negative

Do NOT go. \n\nMost unfriendly and bored hairdresser I've ever had. Did not even ask how I wanted it before cutting. Or at any time while he was cutting. A stone would've been more professional. Will not revisit.,0,negative
Lady was nice and did a good job on my sons hair.  My son is 6 and can be a pain in the butt with clippers.  She was done in 10 minutes too!  Only reason it's not a 5 star is because its just a haircut.  No cleanup or gel or anything after.  No water or cool amenities.  Worth the $7.99 I paid after coupon.,1,positive
The cut grew out really weird in a matter of two weeks and the first week revealed a DAMN YOU uneven piece that is impossible to tame or pull into a ponytail.\n\nMy manhunt is still on for the stylist with a $55 cut that grows out beautifully and allows me to keep my fewer-than-three-cuts-per-year personal preference.,0,negative

"For black men's hair, this is not the place. Either I went to the wrong guy or something. All I asked for was a fade and to leave the top and he confirmed that he heard me and started to cut all the hair off the side. Not only that The best part is when is that he was more concerned with working the cash register than cutting my hair. I had a better cut at super cuts. I still struggle to find a barber in Phoenix that knows how to cut black hair.",0,negative

Great 'old school' barber.  My father went to Benny years ago and now I have been going to him.  Straight razor cut and shave is top notch.  Would recommend to anyone who asks.,1,positive
"These guys are true professionals. An old-fashioned haircut, followed by hot foam and straight-razor.  Like something out of the 50s in New York!

She did a great job, listened to exactly what I was asking for, and was very friendly. The atmosphere of the salon is also awesome. I was welcomed with a delicious cup of Aveda tea and had a great scalp massage. My cut was $45 (including wash and style) which I thought was very reasonable. Highly recommend!",1,positive

Cut #2 with Brian ... Still awesome! Got a lip and brow wax too which was nice... Thinking facial next time! Try Brian you'll not regret it!,1,positive
"I am really unhappy with the way the cut turned out. It was tapered poorly, and is noticeably shorter on one side than on the other. I used to go to an old fashioned barber shop near campus in my last city before I relocated here, and always got a decent cut there. Therefore I gravitated to Ray's ASU Barber Shop in order to get a haircut before classes started.  \n\nFor a mere $12, the price isn't too bad, but for the same money I probably could have gotten a better cut at a chain.",0,negative

"Wouldn't recommend this place. My boyfriend had medium length hair but needed a trim. He went in and told Emily (I think) that he wanted to keep the same style and length.

I could've just picked up a pair of scissors and cut his hair better.",0,negative

I needed my natural hair cut and didn't know who to go to in Pittsburgh. I noticed this salon near my office and decided to give it a chance instead of driving all the way back to Columbus for my regular spot. Per usual I consulted Yelp to check out  the reviews. I called and made an appointment with Sanoma. She did an excellent job of questioning me about my hair and my expectations. 2 hours later I left with straight soft and lovely hair minus the split ends. I'll definitely be back.,1,positive
My fianc\u00e9 and I went into minibar ber shop today and he got an amazing cut from Jackie. My fianc\u00e9 has had the same haircut for years and he was looking for something new.

The place is very modern looking and had lots of fun trinkets you could buy for gifts. He will definitely be going back.,1,positive
"Friendly, fair price and I'm happy with my hair cut. As for complaint about having to wait...He works alone, so if you don't make an appointment you may have to wait.

Carl Wellman runs this one-chair barber shop in downtown Mesa and has cut my hair for about 15 years now. He's a sweetheart of a man and turns out 10 minute haircuts with military precision.

This is a guys place. Sit down and talk about sports. Heck even the owner Tanya can hang in the conversation. Manny is who I go to and either one of them has the fade down to a science. Then you will enjoy a straight razor shave on your neck. This barber shop is reasonable and your cut will be on everytime. no hack jobs here I have been going to this shop for more than 5 years.

"Great service, but way too expensive for me.  I get a buzz cut.  No frills.  Just go over my head with a really short blade.  $16 is way to much for that and the most I have paid anywhere in the country.  It should be around $10 - $12 at most.  I will never go back.",0,negative
"I'm very picky about who cuts my hair and must admit that I walked away from The Art of Shaving at the Venetian highly impressed.

"My mother is a hair stylist in California and the only person who I trusted to cut my hair for most of my life. That is until I met Boris at Ahwatukee Barbers. Now, I trust him with my hair more than I trust my own mother. I'm never disappointed by his work. When I was in law enforcement, he always gave me the perfect high and tight. Nowadays, he does an excellent job with more adventurous cuts like the undercut. Haircuts are only fifteen bucks. Don't forget to tip your barber!",1,positive

"If a haircut place messes up a \""""buzz,\"""" it's a bad haircut place. Received a very asymmetrical number 2 haircut, really disappointed. I know Great Clips isn't the gold standard, but this one in particular is really bad and a couple dollars more expensive than other locations- $15 for a mediocre haircut. You're better off going somewhere else, my lesson is learned.",0,negative
Wow is all I can say Carl was very polite and cut my hair faster then a pot of coffee being made lol.Highly recommend this barber shop as I will be returning here from now on great clips and supercuts have nothing on this man.,1,positive
"2nd time, can't find a groomer in Ahwatukee since moving here tried another place it was stinky so tried here again - the groomers/owners are great people but I am disappointed with the haircut again and that I can't communicate with them what I want - a normal haircut for yorkies (been able to do in the past).",0,negative

I hate writing reviews but thought it was necessary to give credit for my awesome cut. I've been going to barber shops for years and thought I would give this spot a chance. I requested Noah based on the reviews I read and was very pleased with the results. Noah listened to what I want  and gave suggestions as went. Everyone was super friendly and the complimentary cleanup between cuts is also a great score! Mos definitely I'll be coming back!,1,positive

"finally got a good haircut at a discount chain. after waiting about 20 minutes, i was seated and greeted much more pleasantly than i ever have been at my former go-to Great clips. yes, she used the #3 guard, but she was slow and steady and pulled and picked to make sure all my hairs were nice and even. \n\nused the scissors to even things out and even got my cowlick and ears cleaned up. i'm keeping my fingers crossed that i've found my new discount hair 'cuttery'.",1,positive
LOVED LOVED my experiance! My poor Schnauzer was such a mess! I have been looking to find a groomer since I moved to gilbert/seville and couldnt find one I liked. So thankful I listended to my fellow yelpers. It cost about an extra $25 than the normal groomers but so worth not leaving my poor old dog in a kennel for 5 hours like other groomers. The groomer did such a great job on the cut I signed up for auto-rescheudling!,1,positive
"I received my first haircut here as a curly girl!  Terri cut my hair, using the Deva technique ( wedge cut).  Of course I was a bit nervous at first--but after having a short consultation with her before having my hair cut I was totally comfortable.  I loved the results and she even told me to come back if I had any straggly ends.  \n\nI love everything about this salon, everyone is friendly, unlike some salons, where you walk in and the shop goes completely silent. LOL.  The owner is awesome too!\n\nTHANKS TERRI!",1,positive
"Tony is awesome. The best hair cut I have had here in the valley. I will be a regular. I am glad I found him, my hair is cut perfectly. He worked with me when I really had no idea what I wanted.

Went to get my haircut at his new place on 10th ST and Indian School last Saturday.  The new place is definitely better than the old place and he always takes his time with you.  He doesn't rush things.  This is a great alternative to franchised places who treat you like a number.,1,positive
"Worst haircut I've ever gotten. The stylist cut my bangs way too short and uneven, she obviously has no idea how to cut curly hair (she insisted that after flat ironing them they'd be perfect, but my hair will always have a little poof in it). Stay away!",0,negative
Worst haircut I have ever had I don't understand how these people are still in business if your old and you want a boring haircut go to V's if your young and you want a nice haircut don't let your foot step in there. They will also get mad at you if you ask them to cut your hair a little shorter after there done 20 bucks 30 dollar tip first time and last time I just hope you people can learn from the mistake that I made.,0,negative
Cut #2 with Brian ... Still awesome! Got a lip and brow wax too which was nice... Thinking facial next time! Try Brian you'll not regret it!,1,positive

"I had an absolutely AMAZING experience! For all your hair cut/style/color needs, you MUST see KC! ! I found KC on therescuestore.com. I got an AWESOME new hairstyle as my reward for donating to Central's care ministries. KC is a master at making your hair look the best it's ever looked! I walked out if there feeling like a celebrity! Because I have curly hair I have always struggled in finding someone who knows exactly what to do with it! My curly hair has found it's soulmate in KC! Thanks KC!",1,positive
"Usually quick, haircuts are a bit iffy. I think a couple of their stylists are a bit rude. You get the service you pay for. For the price, see Fabian next door at the Canyon salon for a $5 haircut for kids. He actually did a superb job for half the price.",0,negative
"Fantastic cut by Cole! He was meticulous and really listened to what I wanted done as well as adding his own professional and stylish touches to make my hair look great.

We spotted this place and decided to give it a shot.\n\nMy wife was really happy with the result, and the price was not unreasonable (which made her even happier).  We'll be coming back.  I may even get MY hair cut here (it's getting close to time!).",1,positive

This place is awesome.  We have seen 3 different people and they all did a great job not only on his hair, but in keeping him comfortable and entertained (they have a TV at each station).  \nSo my little guy gets a great haircut, the warm towel treatment, and gets to watch Spongebob - all during a task he used to hate.",1,positive
"My haircut was OK.  I got no water, no scalp or neck massage.  My hairdresser, Charles, left me more than once to do consultations on other clients.  I felt like he rushed my haircut, because I think he had another client booked too close to my appointment time.  He also frequently turned away to socialize with coworkers.  The salon was dirty and a little bit shabby.  $93 before tax/tip for a trim.  I will not go back.",0,negative

There are no gaps to make my scalp visible.  There is also no braid headache after her service.\n\nThis is my second time getting braided by Sean & it won't be the last. When I reluctantly took the first braids out, my hair had grown so much and my edges were intact. If you follow her simple care instructions, you will see amazing hair health.\n\nPS She's licensed!",1,positive

Last barber on the left was who helped me. Very nice but not very skilled. He uses plastic guards for his shears and also I noticed after washing my hair I have very thin parts that were cut much shorter than the rest of my hair. Luckily my hair grows fast. I trusted Yelp! reviews but they let me down. I may try one of the other barbers with real shears once more but I am hesitant to recommend or go back here with  confidence.,0,negative
The lady that cut my hair had no idea what she was doing.  She was just clipping away quickly.  I came home only to see that my hair was cut uneven (the right side was an inch longer than the left side of my face).  The worst hair cut I've ever had in my life.  I went back the next day and another lady fixed it where it's now decent.  But I will never go back.  It's geared more towards guys.,0,negative

Stay AWAY from the black dude at the shop! He literally cut me on my face and acted like all was okay. I'm not certain if it was deliberate or he's just that retarded and incompetent. Visiting this shop sincerely dampened Vegas as I wore my gash like a freaking face tat. My buddies were served from the other barbers and their cuts came out decent. I so should've followed their lead.,0,negative

"Genesis is the absolute best. I've gone to her for more than a year now, every 3-4 weeks, and the cut is consistent and awesome. Her attention to detail separates her from any other stylist I've ever gone to.\n\nIf you're a guy and you care about your hair, you can't do better than Genesis for a cut. Not cheap at $35 + tip, but it's worth every penny.",1,positive

The folks at Jimmy's really know how to take care of you! If you want a old school barber to give you a great cut this is the place. Usually I know what I want or think I know as in haircuts.

Glad to have this place in my neighborhood!,1,positive

I was changing my style pretty drastically so I was apprehensive. I showed him a couple pics, he asked some questions and went to work. One of the best cuts I've had. Ever.

"Mr. Lee's a really great guy to talk to. He's been cutting hair in the Waterloo area for about 12 years now, and his experience will be seen on your haircut. With a down-to-earth barber, unique place, and great haircuts,, Mr. Lee's Hair Fashions is definitely a better alternative to barbers near UW.

"I'm a young male who just wanted a pretty simple haircut w/ no styling, so take this review with a grain of salt.  However, there was no wait, the stylist understood exactly what I wanted, and the whole deal only cost $13 plus tip.  From what I understand, this rate is reduced further to $10 on Tuesdays.  Worth a look!",1,positive
"I know I write a crazy amount of reviews about this place, but it really is so great. I have bangs that grow out fast so I constantly need them trimmed. Liz has been really great to work me in on busy days and give my bangs a quick trim when they need them. At other salons, I've had to come in for a full haircut when I wanted my bangs fixed and I usually had to make an appointment way in advance. I really appreciate how willing they are to work with you here and they always do a fantastic job.",1,positive
Lady was nice and did a good job on my sons hair.  My son is 6 and can be a pain in the butt with clippers.  She was done in 10 minutes too!  Only reason it's not a 5 star is because its just a haircut.  No cleanup or gel or anything after.  No water or cool amenities.  Worth the $7.99 I paid after coupon.,1,positive

I called first looking for an experienced barber was told to come in that Pat had 19 yrs experience. The service was quick and friendly. However the cut was choppy and sloppy. My hair is easy to cut and hard to mess up but Pat managed to mess it up. I will never go back to Roosters.,0,negative
I am very happy with the haircut I got: I was trying to grow out my pixie haircut and the lady cut my hair into a very stylish bob. All for 17$ (which is a steal when you know the average haircut in Montreal is more around 80$).\nShe asked me how I wanted it done and most importantly the length I wanted to keep.\nI have an other appointment there in 2 weeks and I am looking forward to it.,1,positive

Spencer the barber is great - I highly recommend the shave!!,1,positive
I was working in AZ for a couple of weeks and needed a haircut (fade) Tony cleaned me up just as good as my regular barber and for the same price! Looks like I found my AZ barber.,1,positive
Recently moved to AZ from CA.  Needed to find a stylist who knows how to cut hair.  Found a great stylist at Lynn-Matthew Salon who listens to what you want and follows through with a great haircut.  Call and make an appointment with Harley.,1,positive
"As a perpetual haircut procrastinator, I'm always looking for a convenient place that's open late. \n\nI walked by the Great Clips Biltmore about 7:30pm, checked in online and by 8:15 had a great looking cut from Glen. I'm a fan!\n\nAnd all the stylists are great looking, too!",1,positive
My husband is fussy about his haircuts and has had a hard time finding anyone who cuts his fine hair well.  I had not looked at Yelp for a barber but did look and found this 5 star place near home. And he is ecstatic about his wonderful haircut. Let alone the reasonable price.  He will be back to Eileen again!,1,positive
"Visited Julie at Karma today, and received the best haircut I've had in years! I'm very picky when it comes to having my haircut which translates to being an annoying client, but Julie was patient and listened to what I wanted before cutting. I love my hair and will definitely be going back! Thanks, Julie!",1,positive
"Just got my first service here today and couldn't be more pleased. The cut was quick & easy but very precise, and the finish with a straight razor was unexpected. \n\nI plan on coming back for a straight razor shave, somehting I've always wanted to have done.",1,positive
"By far the most painful hair cut I've ever gotten with clippers, even worse than navy boot camp haircuts.  The lady who cut my hair didn't care one bit, and I had to point out multiple spots she missed, more than once.  Worst haircut I've ever had, bar none.",0,negative
"Genesis is the absolute best. I've gone to her for more than a year now, every 3-4 weeks, and the cut is consistent and awesome. Her attention to detail separates her from any other stylist I've ever gone to.\n\nIf you're a guy and you care about your hair, you can't do better than Genesis for a cut. Not cheap at $35 + tip, but it's worth every penny.",1,positive
Cut #2 with Brian ... Still awesome! Got a lip and brow wax too which was nice... Thinking facial next time! Try Brian you'll not regret it!,1,positive
"i`ve had a bad haircut before but not like this. its not even fixable. not that i would set foot in the door again anyway. no idea what the womans name is that cut my hair but you could tell i was bothering her  by asking for a haircut. never said a word, never bothered to ask if it was an ok haircut etc..now i get to look like an idiot til this crap grows out. thanks lady.",0,negative
So happy with my cut. The last time I got my hair cut (somewhere else!) I was so unhappy so I was a little nervous but Brianna did an awesome job. Just cut off a few inches and gave me some layers but I'm so happy with how it turned out :),1,positive
"I went to Marconi's on January 30, 2013. Marconi gave me hands down the best haircut I've had since I moved to Charlotte in 2004.    The decor is modern, with accents of major league baseball everywhere.  I arrived first thing in the morning and had no wait.  The shop has a diverse clientele.  You'll have uptown attorneys like me waiting along side laborers, all in search of a good haircut.   I've found my barber \""""home.\""""",1,positive
"Ive been to a few greatclips and other haircut stores and only found a hand full of good stylist.  I go to this location, because of Eric. He cut my hair the way I like it and its always perfect.  We always talk story and he has the best attitude.  If he's not working, I'll leave and come back when he's in.",1,positive
"I spent $32 on a trim. It was a dry cut. No shampoo or blow drying done. And a tip was requested. \nHonestly, that cost was pretty damn high for what I received. \nI won't ever return but ask before you commit to any service. I did not expect it to be that much.",0,negative
"I'm a young male who just wanted a pretty simple haircut w/ no styling, so take this review with a grain of salt.  However, there was no wait, the stylist understood exactly what I wanted, and the whole deal only cost $13 plus tip.  From what I understand, this rate is reduced further to $10 on Tuesdays.  Worth a look!",1,positive
"Thank you Kathy!  I've been here before for a quick cut and style and again, for $35, it doesn't get much better than this.  I'd pay more for the quality I get here.  Been to James many times in the past, but called last minute and was booked with Kathy for the first time.  Very impressed and I have my layers back again and was in and out in no time.  :)",1,positive
"So fresh and so clean..clean! I've had many hair cuts, but Elliot hooks it up. His services are just a step above the rest. There is big difference between some one with passion for their profession versus someone just trying to collect another paycheck. Keep up the good work my man!",1,positive
"I have a 17 year old Cocker Spaniel. He's had A LOT of hair dos in his time.  A LOT. This is by far the best one ever. I mean it. His ears are perfectly rounded, he hates to have his feet touched yet they are perfect. He has a lot of old man bumps and usually they get knicked. Not one!! I think the groomers name was Chris. Thank you so much!!",1,positive
Maggie trimmed my bangs and I was very disappointed with the result. The bangs were cut too short and unevenly. I have to pin them up until they're long enough to trim again. I definitely would not recommend her!,0,negative
"Babak took me as a walk in and he did an awesome job!  I used to only go to a fast and simple corporate place like sports clips, great clips, super cuts, or a cheap barber shop.  I won't be going to those places anymore because Babak knows what he's doing and he makes me look good!",1,positive
I recently had my hair cut here with my son. Christy W was great and worked well with our picky styles. Thank you to the entire staff. We will be back.,1,positive
"I know I write a crazy amount of reviews about this place, but it really is so great. I have bangs that grow out fast so I constantly need them trimmed. Liz has been really great to work me in on busy days and give my bangs a quick trim when they need them. At other salons, I've had to come in for a full haircut when I wanted my bangs fixed and I usually had to make an appointment way in advance. I really appreciate how willing they are to work with you here and they always do a fantastic job.",1,positive
"I don't get all the negative reviews.  Granted, we only went once, but we feel like this is our new breakfast spot.  \n\nThe food was great.  We had the Sausage Pie, the Heavenly Hash, The Crazy Biscuits and a chocolate chip pancake - EVERYTHING was great.  Everything.  The service was great too.  Coffee and water was always refilled.  There was nothing wrong with our visit.  There was everything right.  : )\n\nWe'll be back.",1,positive
"Loved it, everything is fresh and delicious, yes u can't be in a rush here but they take their time to explain what they offer so u know that u will enjoy it.  It's breakfast, take your time so u can enjoy the rest of your day, we will!!!",1,positive
Saw the reviews and they all looked great. Unfortunately the wait for just a basic breakfast was over 25 min. I'm guessing that based on reviews that this was a one time event but still happened. For was good.,0,negative
"Very basic and nit very good. plastic scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage...Fruit, cereals, and ughurt...Kind of like a high school cafeteria. Really bad when you compare it to M.",0,negative
"I ordered the eggs Benedict and it was bland. The French toast was huge, light and airy but the syrup tasted like it was out of a Kroger brand bottle. Also the oj was not fresh, probably out of a frozen concentrate. \n\nThe service was good and prices ok.",0,negative
ya not so much the lattes we ordered were probley the worst i have had to date tasted like warm milk . the breakfast was ok but served room temp . the employs all lacked personality.prices $$$,0,negative
"My husband and I had breakfast here about a month ago and now that I am sitting down to do the review I find that neither of us can remember what we ate or how the service was or anything remarkable about the experience at all.  It was completely forgettable.  If you like generic chain restaurant breakfasts, then this place is for you.",0,negative
Overall the place is pretty good.  Omelets are huge and the food is good.  Service is usually spot on.  It has a bright and friendly atmosphere.  Not sure what these other yelpers are talking about.  Bacon was salty?  Isn't bacon suppose to be naturally salty?,1,positive
"The Good: I have attended this bakery a few times, and every time the paninis are fantastic. The chicken pomadori and hibiscus lemonade are to die for.\nThe Bad: The staff was slow, and the service wasn't entirely pleasant.\nThe Ugly: Basically everything on the menu besides the paninis and a few salads are almost inedible. The macaroni and cheese is rubber-y and tasteless. Other sandwiches are average.",0,negative
"Breakfasted at LePeep on Saturday.  Service was good.  The pancake special sounded delicious: bacon and pecan.  Ordered one.  It was okay.  The \""""signature\"""" potatoes were dry and a paltry serving.  Other than there being something vaguely familiar about my waitress, it was an uneventful visit.  As I said, food was mediocre.  Won't try it again.",0,negative
"Slight step up from Denny's. Take it or leave it. Just don't come with high expectations. Omelet was ok, potatoes were under cooked and coffee was meh. Wife's skillet had a large black hair-she's blond.",0,negative
Food and coffee - 4 stars\nService - 0 stars\n\n\nWe got our coffee and then the crepes came .... ONE HOUR LATER! They told us that they had only two griddles and it would be 10 more minutes. When I told her to cancel it cause we're going elsewhere the crepes starting coming out one after another after another. Obviously they forgot our order \n\n\nTip: make sure you check on your order every ten minutes cause the service sucks and their order tracking system needs some work,0,negative
"This place is not all the hype! \n\nChicken was a little greasy. Sides were bland. Really the \""""eggo\""""-ish waffles were not great either. The grape kool-aid was all sugarfied! \n\nTip: Go to Church's chicken and make your own waffle.",0,negative
"Terrible breakfast. I chose the simplest dish. Potatoe was cold, breakfast sausage was not fully thawed. Egg was OK. The toast came with frozen butter. At least i got normal coffee and lots of jam!\nService was average. Decor and background music above average.\nGo somewhere else for food. I cant comment on their coffee though.",0,negative
"If you are looking for a classic breakfast that you can get at Ihop this is the place for you. Service was ok, food was ok, and the fresh squeezed juice had huge chunks in it that you could not drink. We are big foodies that love breakfast and were so excited to try a new local spot and were very unimpressed. They still have a lot of kinks to work out. We wish them the best but probably won't be back. Good thing we used a groupon.",0,negative
"I had what has to be the most awful dining experience of my life at this hash house! It was terrible service, both waitress and manager were rude. We complained about the food being cold and the manager took our breakfast back and microwaved it and had the worst attitude ever about it. We were never offered any refills on our drinks. It was an overall very, very disappointing experience. I wish I could give 0 stars!",0,negative
"We were happy to find a place to get a good waffle.  The omelette I ordered was good, I would have preferred the veggies were cooked more.  I didn't think the dishwasher should be answering the phone to give directions either (got me lost), but all in all.  It was an honest to goodness Breakfast Joynt.",1,positive
"Horrible!!!  Potatoes are extremely greasy, burnt eggs, slow customer service, bland taste. I go to breakfast on a regular basis and this is by far the worst I have ever experienced.",0,negative
"Good food, fast service, well priced...we shared crepes, eggs w/chicken sausage (tasty) & pancakes. Portions are large.\nEspresso gets 2 thumbs up\nOrange juice is freshly squeezed & DELICIOUS",1,positive
"Like a better version of Panera.. The 9 grain bread was delicious and fresh. The chicken salad sandwich was interesting with jicama, but good. I liked their sunflower salad, though it was a bit too heavily dressed. I would definitely go back again.",1,positive
"the ugly stepchild of Binkleys.  I'm a huge fan of Binkleys, but they should have just stopped at that.  The fries are amazing, but I don't spend that kind of money to go eat french fries.  The sole barely had enough meat to justify serving anything on the plate.  Moreover, that minimalist portion of sole was overcooked.  Our waiter was irritating and trying way too hard but still didn't quite get his role.  I'd go back, but certainly not anytime soon.  I'd rather save my money and go to Binkleys.",0,negative

What can you say about any Waffle House. They do an excellent job at being what they are trying to be. I always enjoy the food and the service. If you're expecting it to be something it isn't then you'll likely be disappointed. I will go back to this one and enjoy every greasy morsel.,1,positive
"Food is average at best. Customer service and choice is discouraged. Don't want a fatty potato option in your meal? Too bad, you can't substitute for something cheaper or pay for something more expensive. Never been to a breakfast place before this that didn't let you make it your way within reason.  First time here and last time here.",0,negative
"I came here a few months ago, and wasn't impressed.\n\nThe menu is huge - the print is very tiny on the menu up behind the counter. I ordered the egg salad sandwich not toasted. They toasted it, and it just wasn't anything special. It wasn't bad, but I could have made a better sandwich myself. Probably won't be going back.",0,negative
Great service- even better food had the loaded breakfast sandwich the egg was cooked perfectly the hubby ordered the bagel and lox -very fresh. Has the cheese curds to start with- best decision ever. Very happy with food and service.,1,positive
"I ordered the biscuit special.  I was excited because biscuits and gravy are my favorite.  Unfortunately the restaurant does not live up to its name.  The biscuits were bland (and obviously not made from scratch as claimed), the gravy had no flavor and the eggs were oily.  Our waitress was really bad as well, so that didn't help.\n\nIf you want to have a Denny's experience",0,negative
"I've eaten at Hubbard Ave Diner many times.  Great pie, good service, average food, really inconsistent execution by the kitchen.  If they aren't busy, you've got a good chance to have your order arrive correct (as in get what you ordered as you ordered it) and hot.  If they are busy, forget it.  They really need to have an expediter in the kitchen.",0,negative
The food was okay. The crumb cake they serve hot was amazing but the eggs Benedict was just average.,0,negative
"uh Oh, gotta change my review, went last night ordered the graveyard breakfast steak and eggs, Steak was very cold, eggs was cold, hashbrowns were also luke warm; Food just wasnt hot at all from the kitchen, nor was my partners plates.  Okay, in all fairness to The Courtyard cafe, I noticed every other table around us that patrons were all ordering the exact same thing and that was the Prime Rib Dip so that must be the one good thing that they have.",0,negative
"Unfortunately we were very disappointed! While the decor, the ambience and the menu all looked great the food left a lot to be desired. \n\nHigh points: the eggs were well cooked, the scone was delicious and the bacon on the meat platter was outstanding!\n\nLow points: the veggie patty in the bubble and squeak was undercooked, chunky, under seasoned and the patty was way too thick. The potato hash was undercooked and pretty bland. The breakfast sandwich was only ok. \n\nService was friendly, and fast.",0,negative
"Awesome! 3 visits, 3 different meals, all 3 I would gladly eat again!! Waffle was crispy on the outside & fluffy on the inside. Comes with meat & eggs, sausage links were good. Chicken fried chicken was delicious. Country Benedict was also delicious. Hash browns cooked just right. Even the coffee is awesome. 6 or 7 other menu items I'm dying to try. Place is friendly, well run, & clean. Highly recommend!!",1,positive
"Absolutely delicious  breakfast. Had the steak and eggs, the steak was something that tasted like it came out of a mid tier steak house. I was very very impressed. The staff was warm and friendly.\n\nHowever, I guess it did take a touch too long for the food to come out since it wasn't super busy, and their bloody mary was of low quality.\n\nI left with a full heart and a full stomach though.",1,positive
"I want to give a better review, but unfortunately today's experience was too poor to overlook.\n\nBad experience today... Low inventory, really slow service, their signature breakfast item is the muffins. While I was standing in line they ran out of almost everything and apparently weren't prepared with any new muffins baking. \n\nI walked out instead of getting breakfast.",0,negative
"Wish I could write a review. The menu looked tempting online and I took immediately to the Ham, Egg, and Swiss waffles. There is a location very nearby but I have never been. So I called for takeout breakfast. After the hostess answered the phone I was put on hold for 8 minutes before I finally hung up. Nice try but I won't bother with Mimi's again.",0,negative
"Do yourself a favor, ask to sample the gravy...it's ridiculous. I would have given it five stars had the pancakes been better. They seemed to be missing some flavor depth. Ham is good, eggs are good, service is good. \n\nI also like that the place doesn't try to cram 400 people into the place (which they could). \n\nOverall, their Yelp reputation is well deserved. \n\nP.S. They're moving in two months (today is Nov 7, 2014).",1,positive
"Really good! I just got the plain french toast and it was amazing! I loved the French press for my green tea. My only complaint would be the servers don't come around a whole lot, we got our order, our food and our check. I know they're kinda busy but I needed maple syrup and not a single server came near me and I had to grab a girl after she was taking someone else's order to get me some and I felt really bad. \n\nBut the food is A+!",1,positive
"Tad bit disappointed this morning with the breakfast. Chicken, egg & cheese bagels were bland and seemed to have shrunken in size. Both were ordered regular but one came without the cheese. To our luck as the Mrs. Didn't actually want cheese. The restaurant must not have been wiped down the night before as it was plain to see that the booth walls and backs of chairs were covered in greasy fingers and hand marks. However the highlight was that service was adequate and associates were polite as always.",0,negative
"Well, The pie is good. The coffee is good. The restroom was gross. But they did have lots of parking. My breakfast was 75% correct. As the Yelp 2 Star rating says: Meh. I've experienced better.",0,negative
"The service was horrible, eggs were cold, toast was cold, hash-browns were so greasy we both had to blot off the oil with napkins, and they were under cooked, now that is not easy to do, greasy and soggy. \n\nAll in all. save your money and head some were else!\nThis place is a ripe off!",0,negative
"I've heard a lot about this place and maybe my expectations were high but I wasn't impressed. THe breakfast potatoes were bland, the eggs were extremely oily, the pancakes were too doughy... not my favorite place at all but I liked the old diner look and feel to it. I would go back just for the ambiance. The service was great ... the waitress was on top of her game, super sweet.",0,negative
"Have eaten here before and it was really good.  This morning less than average. Husbands home fries dried out and tasteless.  Sliced tomatoes I got instead of potatoes equally poor.  Both our omelette's just ok.  I ordered an egg white with asparagus and crab, with the holendase on the side. I think there were tomatoes in there, but not sure what they were?  Also one of the asparagus end you snap off made it into my omelette - yuck.  Service slow and it wasn't very crowded.  We will eat somewhere else tomorrow",0,negative
"This is the 3rd time at Toast and I can definitely say I won't be going back. \n\nHere is the lowdown on my thoughts:\n\nService - 2 stars\nBloody Mary - 1 star (mix is awful)\nChicken wrap- 4stars.... Lots of chicken in that wrap, had service been better to have sauces - it would have been much better \n\nOthers breakfast were rated around 2-3 stars... We were w a group of 6\n\nWouldn't go back, so many other great places",0,negative
Not impressed. Ordered Ham steak and eggs for $8.99. If the ham was shoe leather it would'nt be enough leather to resole my 18mo grandsons shoe. $3.99 for one dinky biscuit with gravy (which was horrible) come on. hash browns were cold and flavorless. service was so-so. You need to get it together. there are better breakfast restaurants out there competing for your dollar. I  would not go out of my way to return,0,negative
"I used to love Bob Evans.  Not sure if I've changed or they have, but I have to say I was not impressed this morning.\n\nThe sausage is still good, but everything else tasted like crap.  You mileage may vary.",0,negative
This place was surprisingly superb. I'd purchased a groupon and thought what the heck. I ordered the chicken and waffles based on the recommendations of yelp. I was not disappointed as the waffles were the best I've had in this area and the chicken was seasoned well and tender. I will return here despite it being far from my home in north Charlotte.,1,positive
"First time here & I guess we should have had breakfast. Maybe breakfast is better but their lunch menu is sub par. Chicken avocado sandwich came much later than the test of the food, the bun was stale, chicken was hard & dried out & avocado looked like it had been scooped a while ago. We sent it back & they took it off the bill. Club sandwich was just OK. So a 1 and a 3 average to a 2. Disappointing.",0,negative
"This isn't a chain, is it? It feels like a chain... it tastes like a chain... the food is just too prefab. Prefab is OK for cheap housing and fast food, but not for a place that charges about $10- $12 per person for breakfast. \n\nFood is OK... nothing special. They have a well rounded menu with lots of options, but none are so special or so delicious that I would write home about it. \n\nFor me, it's close, convenient and fast... other than that, I would choose someplace else.",0,negative
Mediocre food at best. For breakfast meals you can get better quality for the same price at Ihop. Wish they had more combo meals. Their only breakfast combo that came with eggs and bacon or sausage was their biscuits and gravy. I ordered the waffles and had to order eggs and bacon as sides. They also do not have a kids' menu.,0,negative
"Went this restaurant last weekend for a late breakfast. Had SUPER Sweet with TONS of whipped cream triple chocolate cappuccino, tasted just okay Egg white omelet, and weird sour flavor smoked salmon Benedict. The place is fancy, however, the food is not okay and the price is a little bit too high. Maybe I should just order liquor or dessert over there next time.",0,negative
we frequent Panera Bread in Charlotte all the time. this is our first bad experience at any of them. I had the half Tuna and half Greek salad. The Salad barely had any olives and Feta cheese. I felt ike I was having a Lettuce salad. My daughter's soup of cream and wild rice was lumpy and my Nephew's chicken soup was cold. I dont know if I would ever go back to that particular location but they definitely lack the consistency of the other Panera Breads.,0,negative
"HOT CAKES.  That's really all I have to say.  I was wondering what the fuss was about, and when I took my first bite, it all made sense.  As for the rest of the breakfast items, they're okay.  I ordered corned beef hash, and it seemed like the kind of corned beef that came from a can.  I could be wrong, but it just didn't have much flavor.  The only annoying thing about this place is the wait.  Get there early or be prepared to wait, outside, for a long while.",1,positive
"Food was good! Even though I didn't get my toast. So I don't know why the waitress asked me what kind of toast to go with my California Crepes. I chose sourdough and it says on the menu that I do get either toast or a muffin. Um I didn't get my toast and another waitress told me it doesn't come with it.\n\n\nOn another visit, I had to add some salt/hot sauce to the crepes for flavor because it really lacked..Nicely cooked though.",1,positive
"The newspaper review posted at the entrance says that sometimes a diner is just a diner, and that seems to be what Hanlon's aspires to, but not a very good one.  \n\nWent for Sunday breakfast on a recent trip with the family, and found that most of the food lacked flavor.  The sausage breakfast burrito lacked any punch, the home fries were soggy and bland.  Even my 8 year old said the raisin French toast lacked flavor.\n\nOn the plus side, the prices were extremely reasonable.  Breakfast for 4 under $20.",0,negative
Worst Denny's ever they brought out half cooked food horrible service and to top it off manager was the one who helped us very terrible!!!! NEVER AGAIN next time I'm going to Waffle House,0,negative
"great breakfast place...period. worth the wait. had the stuffed french toast, and the bob's special. french toast was crisp and cooked perfectly, although not really stuffed, just an extra slather of raspberry jam. Bob's special was very tasty, German potato pancakes were a little under cooked but great tasting.  Service was quick and brisk, waited about 25 minutes on a Sunday morning, which was not bad but it was raining this day.",1,positive
"First timer: hmm I really don't know what to say... Id like to say that I'm serious about waffles... Waffle here are mediocre at best... A little too crumbly for my taste, not really any texture, kinda like a fragile chip more like it... the ice cream sandwich was good BUT if you take  the time to go to LAPPERTS in California hotel, you can get an ice cream sandwich with double/triple the scoop, and a dinner plate size bigger cookie for the same exact price... I really don't understand the hype of this place?",0,negative
"I had read the reviews online and wanted to try it.  The food was pretty decent the portions were large.. We took the muffin with us when we left and ate it for lunch on our flight back to TO.\n\nOmelettes were tasty and my husband's home fries were good.  I had fruit on the side in place of the home fries and it was a decent sized portion.\n\nMy husband liked omelette house more so we'd probably not go back.  However, I would recommend this place if you are in the area.",1,positive
"If you order a muffin, it comes out soggy, like it was frozen and microwaved.  Also stay away from the eggs benedict.  Nasty hollandaise sauce, and barely poached egg.  It was like trying to pass of sunny-side-up eggs on english muffins for eggs benedict.  The skillet was good, and I was told that the coffee is decent.",0,negative
"Good friend and I swung into cute cafe, which was totally unfamiliar to me. Initial reaction is that their marketing did a great job. The second reaction is that the kitchen needs to stretch a bit. Reuben is average size but deserves a rye bread, not sweet raisin rye. Thousand island dressing was appreciated. My friend ordered two scrambled eggs; they were served dry and cold. Toast unremarkable.\n\nI did grab the nicely prepackaged sweet crisps for home munching. Pretty expensive indulgence.",0,negative
Went for brunch and had absolutely terrible service. The server was nice but incredibly slow. I ordered the breakfast poutine and it was awful. The toast and biscuits were so stale. Pancakes were also bad. Would not recommend this to anyone.,0,negative
"Their sausage pork burrito was average. There literally was nothing in it but eggs and sausage. The biscuits and gravy was a delicious. Their hashbrowns... Yuck, They were way too buttery and tasted funny. Overall I would give this place another try. The service was friendly. I just hope someone from their staff reads this and does something about their hashbrowns.",0,negative
"I am puking a little in my mouth, just writing this review.  I will never spend another dime at this establishment.  The eggrolls are gross and the insides are mushy and soggy they taste like they have been prepared a month in advance and the vegetables inside have the consistency of baby food. I ordered a sweet and sour chicken. The canned fruit was cold as if the cook had just dumped it onto the plate right before serving.  What a disappointment of a restaurant my family and I use to love eating here.",0,negative
"I really am reluctant to write this awful review because the owner was so nice and the food they used to serve was delish. The new server/ cook/ host has no clue what's on the menu. I ordered my usual lobster Benedict and received one English muffin with avocado and lobster on it ... No eggs, no sauce ... It was disgusting and appalling that a chef wouldn't know that eggs were included in that dish. Oh and it took 1.5 hours to order and get served and we were the only ones there.",0,negative
"When you're in a bread company, you expect the panini (sandwiches) to be awesome. Mine was barely toasted, not cripsy. My friend's sandwich was also limp, and in addition, it was too salty. \nThe service was good and quick. The whole place was spotlessly clean. Their record from the county health dept is excellent. \nThe side salads look/taste like what you can buy at Fry's deli. Yawn....\nI would compare this to a lunch at Subway. Not bad, but not something to go out of your way for, either.",0,negative

"Good breakfast for sure!! Buuuut the service. Omg. Terrible!! Asked 2 times for a straw, water, a spoon and fork were dirty, one of the servers petted a dog and idk if she washed her hands... Then what blew my mind was a server has a cut on their finger and blood was exposed!! Will not be going back and would not tell somebody to visit.",0,negative
"Always great, always freindly, always made the way i want....seriously, why go elsewhere????  i eat pretty cleanas a bodybuilder, I can get fluffy egg white omelettes with no butter, gluten free pancakes, sugar free syrup, crispy hash browns....and never wait too long!  We have been regulars for more than seven years.....still our favorite breakfast spot after all this time!!!  try the skillets too, they are awesome!",1,positive
"ugh...not very good.  had both breakfast and lunch on separate occasions.  sure the variety is OK and the selections unique (chocolate chip waffles!), but the quality seemed sad and lacking.  cost is SUPER CHEAP, so that is nice.  but unless I was staying here (which I was this time), I wouldn't make a special trip.  lines can be HUGE at times, which is yet another negative.  but if you like buffets, give this a go if you're in the area.  staff was excellent on both occasions, so that was nice.",0,negative
"Good friend and I swung into cute cafe, which was totally unfamiliar to me. Initial reaction is that their marketing did a great job. The second reaction is that the kitchen needs to stretch a bit. Reuben is average size but deserves a rye bread, not sweet raisin rye. Thousand island dressing was appreciated. My friend ordered two scrambled eggs; they were served dry and cold. Toast unremarkable.\n\nI did grab the nicely prepackaged sweet crisps for home munching. Pretty expensive indulgence.",0,negative
"Very Good. The thought of chicken & waffles never sounded good to me, but WOW!!!! This place is great and I can not wait to go back very soon. The chicken is not greasy, the tast is out of this world! \n\nThe service was friendly and helpful while trying to decide. \nGo check it out for yourself- you'll love it too!",1,positive
"I've had decent experiences here in the past, though it always reminds me of that episode of Seinfeld where Elaine is complaining about all the waitresses at Monk's Diner looking the same. Today was pretty terrible. First of all, I ordered buckwheat pancakes, bacon, and hash browns. The butter for my pancakes had a hair in it. The bacon was good. The hash browns were the greasiest I'd ever seen. Just covered in oil. I've had better from Waffle House. I won't be back for quite a while.",0,negative
"HORRIBLE! I've been to the place twice now. Both times I ordered a rib eye and eggs, both times they were out. Why even have it on the menu? \n\nI ordered a steak and eggs and it was not worth the $12 I paid for it. Thin and poor quality. Gross eggs, gross coffee gross everything.\n\nThe customer service is terrible. I walked out of here deciding to never come to this place again.",0,negative
"Let me clear the air about The Flying Biscuit: it's not good. I ordered the steak and eggs, and the steak was advertised on the menu as being medium rare. I've never had such an overcooked steak in my life. It was tough and mealy. My eggs were perfect, but my eggs are also perfect at the Waffle House in Clemson at 4am. My dining partner got the Coca-Cola glazed salmon, but the glaze was neither Coca-Cola nor glaze. I would give the FB one star, but the baked brie saved the day.",0,negative
"I went to brunch this morning at Peculiar Rabbit and was very disappointed. The service was mediocre at best and despite not being very busy the waiter was especially slow. I ordered the chicken and waffles and for $16.00 was disappointed at the quality. While the chicken was good and the portion was large, the waffle was nearly burnt and quite hard. With all of the lovely brunch options in the area I would not return.",0,negative
"The breakfast buffet was great, we were welcomed by staff and the place was set up great. They had all the newspapers laid out. The sausage had a hint of pate in it, quite interesting. The baconwood sausage was thick as it should be. The eggs were mediocre and I felt the same about the salmon.\n\nOverall this place is really good but its quite pricey, about $20-25 with drinks.",1,positive
"I hate to update my review with a negative. Unfortunately, the past couple of times we have been here has just been disappointing. I almost threw away my full cup of yogurt because it was so plain and boring. The yogurt was icy and not creamy at all. I had to add a ton of toppings to make it taste okay. Seating is still horrible. The cheesecake didn't taste like cheesecake. The chocolate is not good. My husband and I agreed that we won't be back :(",0,negative
"Zucchini was really good, burgers were awesome but the onion ribg were just ok.  Great friendly service and place was really clean. We will be back to try there breakfast. Overall good food.",1,positive
"People reviewing this place are drunk.  The one thing that can be said is that the portions are big.  That's it.  Service  is terrible and is VERY slow.  The signature dish of chicken and waffles was TERRIBLE.  The chicken is so dry and bland that you literally have to drink water just to wash it down.  It was honestly one of the worst breakfasts that I have ever paid for.  Breakfast is one of the most difficult meals to screw up, but these guys managed to do it.",0,negative
The food is mediocre but the price is too expensive\n\nI ordered the egg Benedict and it was average at best\nThe cinnamon French toast was okay but on the too sweet side\nThe American breakfast was comparable to Denny's but at twice the cost\n\nThe food is okay but they need to either lower the cost or improve the quality\nThe portion side tho are large,0,negative
"Look, there is no reason for you to read the 51st review on this place unless you specifically sought me out and you trust me.  Matt's is good!  Go stuff yo face in a waffle and that thick cut bacon.  Mmm!",1,positive
"Looking through the reviews on here- don't expect a full blown restaurant from something advertised as a cafe. \n\nI love the sausage biscuits here, they are amazing, 10x better than anything from Mcdonalds. Their cookies are good too. Give them a try, I think many of these reviews are older.",1,positive
"I wouldn't want to fully draft my true thoughts here, however, \""""very bad\"""" may suffice.  Here's the run down: coffee flavor was marginal, the 3 egg omelette was very small for that quantity & lacked most of 4 requested ingredients, their signature baked pancake is over priced-wafer thin with more sugar than flavor, but the home fries were excellent.  Overall, no need to return.  Thank God I went with a Groupon.",0,negative
I was disappointed in my breakfast.  The coffee was terrible.  The eggs were average. And the service was well below average. Not a place I would go back to.,0,negative
"I was really disappointed. Read so many reviews and decided my family needed to try it. The toppings were good, but the waffle did not taste good- actually the batter was very blah- and they are very overpriced.",0,negative
Terrible. First time here too. Dry dry pancakes eggs were bland and sausage taste different than pork sausage. Won't be coming again,0,negative
"The custard is average, the food is greasy, the place looks like a herd of elephants ran through it.... oh, and the customer service is BAD.  Gets a major \""""skip it\"""" rating from me.",0,negative
I was first shocked by how busy this place was. It was 11am on a Monday and it was rocking which I guess is a good thing. The portions were large as others had mentioned and the Arizona omelet I had was awesome. Pancakes were a little buttery for my liking and I passed on the hash browns because they looked greasy but thats just being critical.,1,positive
"its okay, butit is \""""a Madison institution\"""".  Three of our 4 pancakes were undercooked and doughy. My scrambled eggs were thin and flat. The toast and jelly had no flavor, andsausage was nothing special. The potatoes were good, and the service is friendly.",0,negative
Horrible!! With the word 'Egg' as their business you'd figure they would know how to make medium scrambled eggs. The waffle was cold and the Ham steak was over cooked. Will not visit again.,0,negative
"I ate here number of times and I never had a bad experience. Their breakfast are the best around. Only once did I ordered a dinner meal (it was OK), but I prefer their breakfast.",1,positive
Very nice consistent meal.  We ate breakfast as we usually do when we come to Denny's.  It's a good place to bring the family and get a good meal at a reasonable price.  I had to lower a star for the slow service due to lack of staffing.,0,negative
"After hearing from neighbors that they liked this restaurant we decided to go there for breakfast. \n\nVery nice ambience. \n\nThen, got water and there was hair stuck to it. Had the Lorraine Omelet - not the french eggs I'm used to. The omelet was overcooked and the bacon very overcooked. Otherwise, tasty. Accompanying potatoes very good. Food was only ok and poor value for the money.",0,negative
This review is only for the one in Rainbow and Blue Diamond of SouthWest Vegas.  I go here because it's one of the few Mcdees thats open 24hrs.  Menu and taste is the same as the other Mcdees around town.  Would have gotten one more star if they served breakfast before 5am because I went at 4:40am and they were just doing the lunch menu still. They denied me of a good warm hearty breakfast and had to settle for an unhealthy BIG MAC combo with a coke.,0,negative
Was such a bad restaurant that my mom got physically sick after eating the Chicken Fried Steak. I had the Malted Waffle and it was no better (or bigger) than an Eggo waffle. Very disappointing.,0,negative
"Very basic and nit very good. plastic scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage...Fruit, cereals, and ughurt...Kind of like a high school cafeteria. Really bad when you compare it to M.",0,negative
We were there for breakfast. I had the waffles nothing to write home about. I make better waffles at home with Aunt Jemima mix.  Husband order pancakes eggs sausages well over 9 dollars for that. He did  not even finish his pancakes and thats normally his favorite.  \n\nEnjoyed the interior.. but the food lack in taste and overprice.  Took forever to get the food too.  Perhaps since they are still new.  Management will work out the problems.  Overprice foods. Would not being going there again.,0,negative
"Horrible, over priced, worse than Dennys in terms of quality- and they tacked on a to-tax and mandatory tip for a sandwich to go!!! \n\nBeware!",0,negative

Great selection of traditional and creative new dishes for breakfast. Service was fast and friendly. We sat down ordered and had our food within 5 minutes. I ordered the Kay special it was super cheesy and tasty along with their seasoned fries.. My friend had the stuffed French toast which according To her was amazing!!,1,positive
Saw the reviews and they all looked great. Unfortunately the wait for just a basic breakfast was over 25 min. I'm guessing that based on reviews that this was a one time event but still happened. For was good.,0,negative
"Food is average at best. Customer service and choice is discouraged. Don't want a fatty potato option in your meal? Too bad, you can't substitute for something cheaper or pay for something more expensive. Never been to a breakfast place before this that didn't let you make it your way within reason.  First time here and last time here.",0,negative
"I understand their schtick is to be rude and obnoxious to customers, but that only works if the food backs it up. Unfortunately, the food is mediocre at best. Just your traditional and somewhat generic breakfast/lunch staples. Basically, anyone can make this stuff in the comforts of their own home without the off-putting treatment.",0,negative
"5th time going to Layers, bad service every time. (employees act like they'd rather be anywhere else)\nFood is good, but not worth the cost you pay for portion size on most dishes. \nSadly disappointed.",0,negative

"The Grand Lux Cafe reminds me of a Cheesecake Factory with a much larger budget.\n\nThe menu is just as varied, with soup, omelettes, burgers, and other diner fare. There's also the emphasis on dessert and drinks, and the classy ambiance made possible by cushy booths, high ceilings, and mood lighting.\n\nHowever, The Grand Lux Cafe upped the quality quotient of their goods a good amount. Bread, potatoes, and veggies are fresh -- as they should be.\n\nShame about the runny eggs.",1,positive
"I used to love Scramble, but they have taken their rosemary potatoes off their menu which was a primary item I personally loved and made them different from other breakfast places. It's now IHOP type food. Their eggs are very bland as well, Scramble has definitely changed.",0,negative
Ate here for breakfast while staying at Caesars. Had a cappuccino and the lox Benedict. The $6 cappuccino was okay - could have been stronger. The Benedict was basically okay. One egg was overcooked (solid yolk when cut) but the real disappointment was that the dish was COLD.  I was there at 7:30 and they were not crowded at all.  No excuse for a sub-standard meal. Especially at $30.,0,negative
"Meh. Overrated. Overthought recipes with odd recipe combinations. Overpriced. Good smoothies, liked the waffle. The food is either bland or way overthought.",0,negative
The staff was very nice and helpful. The crepes and waffles were delicious and the toppings were all fresh.,1,positive
"First time here & I guess we should have had breakfast. Maybe breakfast is better but their lunch menu is sub par. Chicken avocado sandwich came much later than the test of the food, the bun was stale, chicken was hard & dried out & avocado looked like it had been scooped a while ago. We sent it back & they took it off the bill. Club sandwich was just OK. So a 1 and a 3 average to a 2. Disappointing.",0,negative
"Do yourself a favor, ask to sample the gravy...it's ridiculous. I would have given it five stars had the pancakes been better. They seemed to be missing some flavor depth. Ham is good, eggs are good, service is good. \n\nI also like that the place doesn't try to cram 400 people into the place (which they could). \n\nOverall, their Yelp reputation is well deserved. \n\nP.S. They're moving in two months (today is Nov 7, 2014).",1,positive
"Food is okay, the pancakes are good and you get big portion. It is nothing spectacular. It's ihop quality food but more expensive. The service was extremely poor. We waited an hour to be seated and another hour to get our food. I would not go back, there are  better breakfast options around the area.",0,negative
"The food and service far exceeded my expectations. And, that is saying something considering I took an out-of-town client there. The fruit, veggie omlette and pumpernickle toast were outstanding. The only drawback is they don't open until 9 a.m.",1,positive
"I really thought the food was great, for breakfast stuff.  Passing by a table, I saw a couple order omlettes....  My God!!  These things were like 4 inches thick and looked like shepherds loaves of bread!!\n\nI ordered Eggs Benidict (Venitian Style) with the sauce on the side.  It comes with potato pancakes.  Muffin, mushrooms, spinich and wonderfully poached eggs that look like mounds of sour cream.  Perfect!  My wife had 3 egg breakfast or something basic like that, also good.  Try the Venitian Eggs!",1,positive
"The food was below the standard I expect for a mom & pop breakfast joint. I had steak and eggs. Although the steak was tender, it was poorly seasoned - even A1 didn't make it tasty. The eggs were bland as hell and don't get me started on the \""""ranch\"""" potatoes. If I go to a mom & pop for breakfast I want real potatoes not frozen packaged potato squares. They were simply dismal. The waitress was nice though.",0,negative
"I haven't been here for a while & it was a mistake coming here this time for breakfast.   All of the food that arrived was served cold & my eggs were improperly cooked.  Overall, the food quality, execution & service was poor.  Needless to say I will not be back!",0,negative
"Our breakfast was excellent.  The lemon ricotta pancakes were truly inspired.  Unfortunately our waiter-- while friendly-- was too busy eating, chatting with other waiters, and generally goofing off, so our service was sub-par.",1,positive
I am very disappointed in the service of this place. Fist the server was very unfriendly and we had to remind him every time we needed something. I bought a $9 protein shake that tasted terrible. I brought this to my servers attention yet he did nothing to correct the problem. I thought he might of taken it off the bill but he didn't. The breakfast was actually very good so i still gave this place a 2 star.,0,negative
I went here afte checking the reviews and it was close. This place is ok I usually give spots another chance so I will update soon but for now I really wasnt amazed. I had a waffle breakfast sandwich and it tasted like something i couldve made at home.,0,negative
"The service is ok but the food was terrible! I had eggs benedict and I was greatly disappointed! The hollandaise sauce was nasty, the ham was cold and the english muffin was cold as well. The potatoes aren't seasoned and instead of cooking the onions with the potatoes, it looks like they just sprinkled the onions on top! The only reason I gave it two stars is because the apple juice and coffee were both good!!",0,negative
"Most of the reviews are about the food, which honestly isn't that great. The service was truly horrible. I had two servers and they spilled orange juice on the table and didn't clean it up. I don't know their names because they didn't give them to me. They didn't ask me how the food was, they didn't give me a to go box, and they didn't even wait until I left to check the tip I left. Everyone was rude and I've had better food at IHOP. I'm definitely never going back",0,negative

"If you order a muffin, it comes out soggy, like it was frozen and microwaved.  Also stay away from the eggs benedict.  Nasty hollandaise sauce, and barely poached egg.

"It really wasn't that good. I am a bigger fan of Yogurtland and Menchies where I can serve myself, and add my own toppings.\n\nI'm not a snob per se, but there's more to this. I didn't care for the flavor selection (I mistakenly ordered coffee), and the texture was a bit too rich for my palate.\n\nIt's clean. The bathrooms are impeccable. But ultimately, I walked out of here with a sad look on my face because it didn't live up to my Fro-Yo expectations.\n\nThis really could've been better. \n\nSad face.",0,negative
"Had the Basic breakfast.  The ham really is great, as were the pancakes instead of toast.  Because of the good biscuits and gravy reviews, I ordered a 1/2 order on the side and was impressed.  I rarely like restaurant gravy (never meaty enough for my taste), and this gravy was really good.\n\nService was outstanding, they just seemed to go out of their way to make sure everything was o.k.  and seemed genuinely interested in making sure I had a great breakfast experience.\n\nPatio is dog-friendly.",1,positive
The waitress took too long to serve us & the food was mediocre at best. I had a crepe but it tasted just like a regular omelette.,0,negative
"Terrible. I gave this place a second chance and was once again disappointed with my $17 omelet ! More feta than omelet, turkey sausage was fried hard and uneatable. Server never asked \""""How's everything ? Is there anything else I can get for you ?\"""" Leaving most of my \""""breakfast\"""" on the plate, I left $20 bucks lighter and once again disappointed. Should have gone to Good Egg but try to support independents. How does this place remain in business ?",0,negative
"Delicious breakfast, original menu, fun ambiance. The  downside  was our long wait for a table (we were forewarned, therefore understandable), but  then on top of that the 60 minute wait from sit down to receiving food. The latter was totally unacceptable, especially at breakfast.",0,negative
"I'm surprised at all of the negative reviews.\nWe had an excellent breakfast!\nLox plate was huge and excellent- a grilled bagel with cream cheese, capers, onions and more smooth, smokey buttery lox than I could eat. Wife had eggs bennie and loved it. Son had  a huge Belgian waffle and licked his plate. Daughter loved her French toast.\nSuper friendly service too!",1,positive
"Breakfast review now....well it's not really very good. The \""""ham steak\"""" is very thin and about the thickness of bologna, so they should not describe it as a ham steak. I don't know why but I am burping egg over and over, yeeech! The chicken fried steak is tough and the batter does not adhere well to the meat, the country gravy is very bland and watery. Home fried potatos are not very good either, just chopped up potato morsels. The place is popular so just keep going there if you like it, for us it's our last time.",0,negative
"I had breakfast again at Raffles for the second time in 2010 this November while on vacation from the Hawaii.  I ordered the Norwegian Benedict and totally enjoyed my breakfast.  The staff seemed to be worn out and zombie-like; maybe due to the 120,000 auto after-market convention people and three battalions of Marines in town for the weekend.\n\nThis time at Raffles; food 4 stars / staff 3 stars.",1,positive
"Wow! I was expecting a Denny's quality of food or a Carrow's quality, and was in genreal prepared for meh. But this shocked me! It was sooo good! Way above a Denny's or anything boring that I was expecting. It was reasonably priced too! The staff were very friendly and it came out quick and hot! I will absolutely come here again.",1,positive
Ate here a couple weeks ago. Had chicken fried steak and eggs. Typical sysco frozen steak with gravy that just had TOO much sausage in it . The gravy was tasty but sausage saturated. I'll bet it would be good on Biscuits though.Service slow but ok.Just better out there.,0,negative
"Very nice for a busy Saturday morning.  Build your own Grand slam for $6.49 is hard to beat for the portions you get.  I had 2 eggs over med, bacon, hash browns and very nice fresh pancakes.  Server was very helpful.  Service A- Food B+.  Will be back.",1,positive
"Been here a few times and return when I have a coupon. Service is friendly, but food is average. Tried pancakes, french toast and a variety of eggs. I've liked the southwestern scramble best.",0,negative
"I had read the reviews online and wanted to try it.  The food was pretty decent the portions were large.. We took the muffin with us when we left and ate it for lunch on our flight back to TO.\n\nOmelettes were tasty and my husband's home fries were good.  I had fruit on the side in place of the home fries and it was a decent sized portion.\n\nMy husband liked omelette house more so we'd probably not go back.  However, I would recommend this place if you are in the area.",1,positive
"Consistency eludes this place.  First two trips were pretty good.  My third and final trip was so awful I will never return.  When you walk in you don't know whether to order at the front, seat yourself, wait to be seated?  The tarragon biscuits are awesome except some are awesome and some are crackers.  My partner had a creamy beautiful hollandaise and mine was a clumpy coagulated mess.  Emailed the owner...nothing.  Good luck with the catering business.",0,negative
"Meh.\nIt's an ok meh, at best.\nLittle bit pricey for what you get.\nIf you get breakfast, the meat is extra on your sandwich, whaaaaaat?\nBurger was mediocre.",0,negative
We had the Mums classic and the eggs Benedict. Both were good. The portion size was not too large. The service was fast and friendly. There were plenty of tables on a Sunday morning. No wifi. The waiter also helped us with recommendations for bars for later in the evening.,1,positive
"Great omelet this am. All the meals I have had there have been above average. Steak dinner is a deal, IMO. \nOnly negative is the comment on the check about the tax. Referred to as \""""Obama's Cut\"""", which is dumb since it's the state sales tax.",1,positive
"If you are looking for a classic breakfast that you can get at Ihop this is the place for you. Service was ok, food was ok, and the fresh squeezed juice had huge chunks in it that you could not drink. We are big foodies that love breakfast and were so excited to try a new local spot and were very unimpressed. They still have a lot of kinks to work out. We wish them the best but probably won't be back. Good thing we used a groupon.",0,negative
"People talk this one up, but to me it was pretty gnarly. I am definitely biased against chains, so take this for what it is, but if you're going to have locations in multiple states- please do breakfast right. Corned beef hash was not good. Not even like it could have been helped. It was not good. Won't go back unless under duress.",0,negative
"Recent visits to Toast; food has been \""""so so\"""". I'm posting this review mainly for the staff service. We had a party of (7) from out of town, and 90% of the staff appeared unwelcoming and inhospitable. A question about how the hash browns were cooked was met with frowns instead of figuring out how to correct the \""""problem\"""". For the poor service alone, we will no longer patronize this location (the food at the Davidson location is great!).",0,negative
This place was surprisingly superb. I'd purchased a groupon and thought what the heck. I ordered the chicken and waffles based on the recommendations of yelp. I was not disappointed as the waffles were the best I've had in this area and the chicken was seasoned well and tender. I will return here despite it being far from my home in north Charlotte.,1,positive
"I showed up at the Pancake Cafe for a late brunch on a Saturday at 2:30 PM. There were a few people eating in the dining room. I stood in the lobby for about 7 min and was not helped or seated.

I hope I can update my review with a more positive experience after that. :)",0,negative
"Marginal experience. Food was not very good. Wait time to order was slow - appears they are understaffed as the front door man was also seating people, getting items from the back room, taking orders, bussing tables, & checking on customers. Steak was undercooked, biscuits were bland, etc. Overall, I'm not surprised because it is Denny's but I'm still a little disappointed.",0,negative
This place is pretty over priced for the mediocre food you get. Service isn't very attentive and I'm pretty easy to please. Had the French toast and it was pretty bland. No one I was with liked their breakfast much either. I wouldn't go back,0,negative
"How people can love this restaurant is beyond me. I've been to multiple locations and they were all disappointing. The only reason it gets two stars instead of one is because I thought their breakfast was OK.\n\nEvery time I go here I am unimpressed. My food comes out cold, overcooked and overall very bland. The only good thing are the biscuits you get to munch on beforehand. Even the cornbread tastes bland. I didn't think that was possible!\n\nBoring and bland. I'd rather spend my money on The Waffle House.",0,negative
"Denny's is hit and miss. Growing up I had a wonderful local Denny's that served piping hot delicious food every time. Unfortunately, our first visit here will be our last. All 3 dishes served at my table were cold and the wait was excessive.  The waitress was very upbeat, friendly and put her best effort forth. However, cold food is unacceptable!",0,negative
"Meh. A little on the greasy side. Went for breakfast and the portions were ginormous. The food was decent, on par with Denny's or Coco's, aside of the huge portions. I'm a fan of the large coffee mugs though.",0,negative
"Frankly, I was not impressed. I was asked \""""links or patties' I chose links, I got patties.. I asked for eggs 'over easy', they were raw around the yolks even though the outside was cooked, looked like they were steamed or something... Bread / toast was below par and over buttered. Marmalade comes out in some kind of pot - why?\n\nSo, short version, I eat out a LOT in these kinds of places - and this is one where I won't be going back. Iowa Cafe just down the road blows it away.",0,negative
"First timer: hmm I really don't know what to say... Id like to say that I'm serious about waffles... Waffle here are mediocre at best... A little too crumbly for my taste, not really any texture, kinda like a fragile chip more like it... the ice cream sandwich was good BUT if you take  the time to go to LAPPERTS in California hotel, you can get an ice cream sandwich with double/triple the scoop, and a dinner plate size bigger cookie for the same exact price... I really don't understand the hype of this place?",0,negative
"This is probably the worst breakfast place in the whole Madison area.\nEven McDonald's pancakes taste better, and at a third of the price!\nbottom line, one star food at two dollar signs price.\nIf you are looking for a better place at a reasonable price in Verona, go to the HyVee restaurant (just next to the HyVee grocery store).",0,negative
Breakfast only rating.\n\nCoffee took 10 minutes to arrive. Cream another 5. \n\nWaffles and side order of bacon - cold.

"Not super impressed by this place. I ordered something simple. A cheese omelet, it was OK at best. Potatoes GREASY! This place gets good reviews and maybe I should have ordered one of the bene's to get a better taste for the place but I also think a simple omlete should be stellar and it was not. I may try it again but I doubt it. There are better places IMO.\nService was good though and they were very nice.",0,negative

"Wow! I was expecting a Denny's quality of food or a Carrow's quality, and was in genreal prepared for meh. But this shocked me! It was sooo good! Way above a Denny's or anything boring that I was expecting. It was reasonably priced too! The staff were very friendly and it came out quick and hot! I will absolutely come here again.",1,positive
"This is a neighborhood Denny's with a bar. Small place and the meal was served on plastic plates and they used plastic mugs for coffee. At best, less than mediocre breakfast. Pamela's was closed and we were really hungry. Service was slow but they were nice about it. I don't plan to return and would choose an alternative.",0,negative
"Had a basic breakfast with coffee, it wasn't greasy which I like and the coffee was good as well. The service was nice. It's good when you're in a mood for a solid diner-type place without the grease.",1,positive
"Here currently for breakfast, ordered lingonberry Bfast and chorizo hash--\n\nWe've had a fair share of Bfast check ins at different places so we're hoping to really have a good experience here.\n\nFood is underwhelming, blintz (pancake) is very very heavy. Servings are quite small compared to say IHOP or Mr.mama's or egg works. \n\nFood service is ok, nothing spectacular. \nAt the end of day, my husband and I both agreed -- we are not coming back. \n\nDidn't finish our food, going home disappointed.",0,negative
"Extremely disappointing. Eggs and sausage were cold. Hash browns tasted like left over from day before with bitter aftertaste. Signature item fresh biscuit was stale, cold and lacked taste. Only saving grace was the Ethiopian coffee. French toast was huge portion and passable but not the best. \nSpoke to waitstaff to provide feedback to kitchen.",0,negative
"Meh...had the green eggs and ham. Hubs had the big breakfast. Was okay--how can you go wrong with breakfast, though.  But I gotta admit that the fresh squeezed orange juice was awesome.  For the overall price, however, considered this restaurant overrated.",0,negative
"To be honest, I'm completely confused by these positive reviews. Our server had long, dirty, tobacco stained fingernails that were poking into our order of eggs when she set them on the table -- gross!! It kind of brings dirt cheap to a whole new meaning for me. And the food just wasn't very good at all. We didn't finish our meals. We just paid and left, and I'm pretty sure we ate breakfast again when we got home. Maybe we just had a bad experience? Or maybe I'm just not a local regular or a hipster?",0,negative
High on pretension.  Service mediocre.  Limited breakfast menu.  Poached eggs were completely overlooked.  Presentation was minimal.  Very overpriced.,0,negative
"This was my first time here. I was kind of skeptical at first since I've never tried chicken with waffles but it was a delicious combination of flavors. I had them add whipped cream and strawberries on top of my waffles. Had a jar of sweet tea which for me was the perfect cool sweet beverage needed while taking a break from the Arizona heat. Lastly, the waitress was great. She had a friendly personality and she made the experience much more enjoyable.",1,positive
"This is what you might expect from Vegas, tropicana as \""""fresh squeezed\"""", corn syrup for maple, incredibly sweet breakfasts that if you're 14 you might like. A mocha cappuccino was clearly made by dumping some chocolate syrup in a cup and putting it under a vending machine. The old lady next to me loved it....doubt she uses yelp. Steer clear.\n\nPleasant setting and strong wifi. ;)",0,negative
"I showed up at the Pancake Cafe for a late brunch on a Saturday at 2:30 PM. There were a few people eating in the dining room. I stood in the lobby for about 7 min and was not helped or seated. Within this whole time, I did not see a single employee. I ended up leaving and going somewhere else. \nI do want to try the Pancake Cafe sometime, so I plan on going back. I hope I can update my review with a more positive experience after that. :)",0,negative
"Great omelet this am. All the meals I have had there have been above average. Steak dinner is a deal, IMO. \nOnly negative is the comment on the check about the tax. Referred to as \""""Obama's Cut\"""", which is dumb since it's the state sales tax.",1,positive
"I've had decent experiences here in the past, though it always reminds me of that episode of Seinfeld where Elaine is complaining about all the waitresses at Monk's Diner looking the same. Today was pretty terrible. First of all, I ordered buckwheat pancakes, bacon, and hash browns. The butter for my pancakes had a hair in it. The bacon was good. The hash browns were the greasiest I'd ever seen. Just covered in oil. I've had better from Waffle House. I won't be back for quite a while.",0,negative
"what can i say that the others haven't? the place is amazing for brunch. my sugar level may have jumped 10 fold but it was well worth it. the sourdough waffles are amazing if you like light, fluffy, waffles with a little more than a hint of sour along with strawberries and a tahitian vanilla bean butter that i wouldn't be embarrassed to eat by the spoonful! also don't forget to order a cheese danish and 2 to go.",1,positive
"Absolute garbage. The rolls were soaking wet, the beef sandwich was painfully bland, and their hotdog was what I would expect at an elementary school cafeteria. Horrible.",0,negative
"Excellent all around today. Took a chance on this place while my mother was visiting and we'd been everywhere else. Nicole was great, attentive and friendly service. Food was very good. I had potato pancakes, eggs, bacon and sourdough toast. Quality was very good, best potato pancakes I've had in a long time. Very impressed with the cleanliness, service, and food. Definitely will be returning!",1,positive
"Typical Diner food, typical diner quality.   I had to return my first order of soft boiled eggs cause they were cooked wrong.   I changed it for scrambled, which looks like it came from a large vat of precook end eggs.  Gross.   The next day I ordered eggs Benedict,...BY far the grossest I have ever had.   Wouldn't ever eat here again.",0,negative
"First time here & I guess we should have had breakfast. Maybe breakfast is better but their lunch menu is sub par. Chicken avocado sandwich came much later than the test of the food, the bun was stale, chicken was hard & dried out & avocado looked like it had been scooped a while ago. We sent it back & they took it off the bill. Club sandwich was just OK. So a 1 and a 3 average to a 2. Disappointing.",0,negative
It wasn't bad.  I prefer my waffles a little lighter and more airy or fluffy or whatever.  I suppose it's that way to absorb the liquid from the frozen yogurt but I chose to go with Nutella and whip cream and strawberries.  The service was awesome.  I'm open to another visit.,1,positive
"The food was alright, eggs not cooked all the way but biscuits and gravy was great., however the service was terrible with late food and drinks halfway through the meal, wrong drinks. I would never come to this place again thanks to the service.",0,negative
"Wasn't impressed,  my ice tea wasn't  brewed that''s for sure.  Breakfast at  Denny's would be an improvement. The hostess and waiter were good.  Gave me toast without butter, but  did bring when asked.  Won't eat there again.",0,negative
Ok the price for 2 for breakfast was over $27.00 without tip. The eggs were not cooked correctly runny when should have been firm. The chicken fried steak was ok not great. Biscuits doughy in the middle. Sausage grave just ok. Will not be going back anytime soon. The service was ok but the food was not really great.,0,negative
"Breakfast is a fine time to eat here. Don't eat here any other time. The supposed brick oven pizza is soggy and nasty with unripe tomato. The other menu items must come from a bag as if you ask for the fish, say, not blackened, this is not possible. The pasta was decent and even al dente but the service surly and got drinks wrong. Really you mess up Pepsi? The guy for breakfast was so nice we came back an we only have regret. Only good for morning.",0,negative
Stumbled on this place for breakfast. I love watching Guy so was excited to try the food.   Unfortunately not impressed at all.  I ordered the Chilaquiles which sounded delicious. Despite the place being very busy my food was just lukewarm when it came out and the whites of my eggs weren't cooked.  I'm all  about a runny yolk but not a fan of runny whites. The service was pretty good though.  It didn't make up for the very mediocre food.,0,negative
"I really thought the food was great, for breakfast stuff.  Passing by a table, I saw a couple order omlettes....  My God!!  These things were like 4 inches thick and looked like shepherds loaves of bread!!\n\nI ordered Eggs Benidict (Venitian Style) with the sauce on the side.  It comes with potato pancakes.  Muffin, mushrooms, spinich and wonderfully poached eggs that look like mounds of sour cream.  Perfect!  My wife had 3 egg breakfast or something basic like that, also good.  Try the Venitian Eggs!",1,positive
"My wife and I had breakfast here. She ordered a bagel, scrambled eggs, and bacon. The bagel was burnt, the eggs were bad, and only the bacon and a side of wheat toast were edible. The location is good, and they didn't screw up my waffle (yet again, how do you screw up a waffle?), but there are far better cafes in town.",0,negative
"Not impressed, went for breakfast...ordered Biscuits and gravy with potatoes and scrambled eggs...food arrived cold, potatoes are sliced to thick and do not cook all the way through and don't crisp at all, biscuit was dry and tough, gravy bland and boring...ran out of gravy before I finished the biscuit....for this place to survive against the many awesome breakfast places in Gilbert, they need to rise to the occasion and step up there food, service, pricing and the decor is sparse and needs some improvement.",0,negative
"Greasy, low quality, disgusting food. \n\nIt's getting 2 stars because the waitress was friendly and the menu doesn't pull any punches: the pictures look exactly like what you get. But what you get is pretty bad. \n\nA friend ordered breakfast patties, they were maybe slightly larger than quarters. The hash browns had the consistency of greasy noodles. The signature waffle was just ok, but nowhere near good. \n\nHow these chains are all over the country I have no idea. Sorry, America.",0,negative
"Garbage.\n\nI went to this place a few years ago and really enjoyed it.  The food was excellent diner food and I was especially fond of their homemade corned beef hash.  If I would have reviewed it a year ago it would have been 4 stars.... but something has changed.  I visited again a week ago with a serious craving for corned beef hash.  Unfortunately, everything was different, and in a bad way.  It wasn't even the same recipes.  My dining partner's omelet wasn't anything to brag about either.  We will not be returning.",0,negative
"Very disappointing. I see all these great reviews on here and we basically walked into a Taco Bell. There's even a drive through... DO NOT COME HERE FOR BREAKFAST!!! They do not have a grill. Instead, they microwave the eggs...",0,negative
"Not impressed, I went here for breakfast/brunch...I was truly disappointed! \n\n-we were shuffled outside to the patio. (Dishes were unclean with dust all over....) \n-the price for the quality of food is not worth it. \n-service is ehhh....\n-if you arent looking for good food and only want  an overpriced mimosa then this is the place for you. \n-bread pudding is savory, ours came out ice cold. \n-i have nothing more to say. \n-maybe they are better for dinner?",0,negative
"I won't be \""""kneading\"""" this place again... It sounded good, but the sandwiches where pretty disappointing. I got the turkey and cranberry croissant. It was rather bland and lacked the gusto that the picture showed. Oh well. The staff seemed pretty nice though. I'm not mad I tried it, I just probably won't be coming back.",0,negative
"We had breakfast in the cafe since we're staying at tha Aria.  The food was overpriced for the quality.  Three eggs were okay, 2 thin slices of bacon, hashbrowns cooked only on 1 side, and cold unbuttered toast - $14.00.  They did serve butter for the cold toast but it was cold and hard.  We could have eaten better food at Denny's across the street.  Very disappointed and we won't return.",0,negative
"We really enjoyed our breakfast experience here! We only waited a few minutes to be seated. Our waitress was lovely. I ordered scrambled eggs without butter/oil and they were prepared perfectly. Actual whole cracked eggs, scrambled. Not a pasteurized liquid egg product that was used in Hubby's omelet. With our check, our waitress also gave us refills on coffee/tea and to-go cups. I will definitely go back!",1,positive
"I was starving at 11pm and was too lazy and cold to walk to planet hollywood for my favorite Earl Sandwich, do decide to try the cafe in hotel..\nBad bad idea... in short, it is over price and sub-par food.\nI had onion soup and white paste, soup wad a little salty and paste was way way too oily.\nI seriously had stomach pain for the whole night and next morning, I gave them 1 more star for their ok service.\nI will only go there for waffle since I had it on last trip and was pretty good.",0,negative
Went here for the first time on Saturday. Extremely slow service on ordering. The old lady was very rude when we ordered. Ordered two breakfast omlette's on the same order with toast. Toast was barley toasted and one omlette came out with a bunch of cheese then the other came out with two shreds of cheese and was over cooked. It wasn't even worth bringing back if I had to put up with ladies attitude again.  Started eating it and it had egg shells in it. I will never eat at this place again. Good luck,0,negative
"I ate here number of times and I never had a bad experience. Their breakfast are the best around. Only once did I ordered a dinner meal (it was OK), but I prefer their breakfast.",1,positive
Breakfast only rating.\n\nCoffee took 10 minutes to arrive. Cream another 5. \n\nWaffles and side order of bacon - cold. Waitress MIA whole meal - never asked how things were or enabled us to get more coffee.\n\n2 stars for my wife's breakfast was fine and they comped my waffles after I complained.,0,negative
"I had expected from a place that specialized in them. We ordered brunch items, and they were good, but quite over priced in my opinion. We spent $75 for breakfast for my little family of four. I would say our meal was worth about half that. It took over 45 minutes for our food to be served after we ordered. The server wasn't very friendly our helpful. Overall, we were excited to try this place, but in the end we were quite disappointed and we won't be visiting again.",0,negative
"Seriously the best waffles i've ever had in my life. I really like this place, and i'll definitely be back. I almost didn't go here because of all the reviews that said how few and far between the seating was. I was happily surprised to see it's really not that small. I was expecting 2 or 3 tables by some people's descriptions, but it was much more than that. It was a normal size sit down cafe. And i'm very thankful for its location as there is not much quality food out in this area. Highly recommend!",1,positive
"This is a review for a breakfast from March 2013. While the food (with the exception of the burnt beignets) was excellent, the service was horrible. Don't know (or care) if my waitress was having a bad day, but she was nasty! She was argumentative, wouldn't refill my coffee (although I was able to ask other servers to do so), and wouldn't clear empty plates from the table. Incredibly disappointing for a Thomas Keller restaurant. Won't be back.",0,negative
"After hearing from neighbors that they liked this restaurant we decided to go there for breakfast. \n\nVery nice ambience. \n\nThen, got water and there was hair stuck to it. Had the Lorraine Omelet - not the french eggs I'm used to. The omelet was overcooked and the bacon very overcooked. Otherwise, tasty. Accompanying potatoes very good. Food was only ok and poor value for the money.",0,negative
"I had one of their skillet breakfast and it was great! Loaded with lots of fixing and enough to bring home leftovers. Our server Donna was also very friendly and we didn't even have to ask for refills, she was fantastic!",1,positive
"We decided to give the griddle a try this morning as our regular breakfast joint was busier than usual. This place just doesn't do it for me. The service is rather random as any of 3-4 people bring things to your table. The food is average at best: eggs were good, bacon limp and french toast thick but not very good. The decor is also kind of random with tables on top of each other and crowded with over-sized condiments. I don't anticipate a return visit.",0,negative
This was my very first experience with this chain.. I was very disappointed.  I was with a friend that raved about how good it was so we stopped in. Mind you it was 530 am.. I asked for a sweet tea and tasted it. It was not sweet so I asked for another and yet again there was no sweetener in it.. my egg sandwich was mediocre. .. needless to say I won't go there again,0,negative
"I went for the eggs benedict. Very disappointed.\nThey use a thick slice of virginia smoked ham, and it was quite greasy.\nThe hollandaise was broken and curdled, and way too spicey. \nThe poached eggs were cooked in too hot of water, the whites were quite rubbery.\nThe service was good, but aloof.\nWaitresses wear tight black pants. Some of them even look good in them.",0,negative
"Coffee was like water and warm, even after I requested for a change. Pancake syrup was runny. As I poured it over the pancake there was like a film over it and once that was broken, it just exploded on the pancake. Yuck. The only reason I gave this place a 2 star was because the server was really pleasant.",0,negative
Very good service. Breakfast was excellent. Biscuits and Gravy are my breakfast devining rod and the ones I got here were very peppery and generously laced with sausage. The biscuits were light and flakey. My Brother Bob got the skillet with Chorizo and enjoyed it. Said the chorizo had a bit of a kick to it. Menu says it's homemade. Definitely be back.,1,positive
Horribly bland food. No flavor what so ever. My wife ordered an omelet with home fries. I ordered the steak with eggs. Neither of our dishes tasted like they had any seasoning what so ever. The pancakes were OK at best. And the best part was the way overpriced bill for crap food.  Won't be visiting this place again.,0,negative

Went here twice for quick food. Seating took a while even though there were a lot of empty seats. Ordered the Denver omelette.\n\nNot that good. I could have made a better omelette and I should have for the price I paid for it. The hash browns were decent. I did like the buttered sourdough.\n\nServers were nice enough but they disappeared for the rest of the meal and I couldn't even flag one down for water.,0,negative
Went out for Sunday breakfast. I had The Country Benedict. Poached eggs on a biscuit with a sausage patty and fried red potatoes. It was delicious. My friend had the pumpkin pancakes.  Hers was also delicious. The service was excellent. Our server was friendly and courteous. Definitely going back again.,1,positive
"Meh, disappointing. The food and service were nothing to write home about. I got the Eggs Benedict. The hollandaise was tasteless and coffee tasted like dirt.  My plate was taken away by Tina without being asked if I was done.  The same server didn't even thank me when she gave me my bill.  I would have had better food and service at Denny's.",0,negative
"There's only one problem with Mimi's, and it's the food!\n\nThe design and concept are great, but the food itself is some of the worst in Summerlin.  It's hard to mess up breakfast foods, but they managed to serve lumps of overcooked eggs and undercooked bacon.  Their croissants are doused in butter, and not even in a good way.\n\nLe disgusting.  (I doubt my French is very good, but it's still better than Mimi's)",0,negative
"Complete disappointment! I've given it two stars simply for the view. I ordered the Cafe Benedict and it was salty, over cooked eggs and bland hash browns. My husband ordered eggs too that we're overdone and salty. Our mimosas were more oj than sparkling, and considering out bill came to just over $62, not including tax or tip, this was the worst breakfast we'd had in Vegas. Will stick to Hash House!",0,negative
"This may not be a fair review, because I did not stay to eat. My review though, is based on the fact that this place is the exact same as Paradise Bakery. Not even the baked goods were different from Paradise. Same cookies, etc. I'm sorry, but are we sheep? Slap a new name on the items? I don't care for Paradise Bakery as it was. Panera USED to be much better, imo. I was at least hopeful to still get some of my favorite Panera baked goods. I truly hope it's just because they just opened.",0,negative

"Just ate at Scramble and had a poor and terrible experience. If your looking for a better experience you are better off going to McDonalds. The food is a poor quality. For example, we ordered a Cinnamon Bun that came with a glob of icing-- poor presentation.  The employees said the orange juice is freshly squeezed however it  was not!! The eggs also tasted like rubber.  My recommendation is to avoid this restaurant!!",0,negative

"Marginal experience. Food was not very good. Wait time to order was slow - appears they are understaffed as the front door man was also seating people, getting items from the back room, taking orders, bussing tables, & checking on customers. Steak was undercooked, biscuits were bland, etc. Overall, I'm not surprised because it is Denny's but I'm still a little disappointed.",0,negative
"Been here a few times and return when I have a coupon. Service is friendly, but food is average. Tried pancakes, french toast and a variety of eggs. I've liked the southwestern scramble best.",0,negative
"I wasn't impressed at all. The servers are helpful. But the freshly squeezed juices are horrible. If your going to charge me $4 it better taste freshly squeezed, hand picked, and good. As far as the crepes I wasn't too impressed. The omelets were dry. Plus the food was pricey. I don't mind paying more for good food but this place just doesn't cut it.",0,negative
"Very disappointing. Went there for a late breakfast (11 am), paid 100$ for 3 people. Rushed, unfriendly service. Tasteless toasts straight from the supermarket. Butter had a weird, cheesy taste. Omelet was just ok. The Verandah gets one star for its nice outside terrace and one star for the mini Belgian waffles, the only dish we had that was above average.",0,negative
"First, Server was in the weeds so bad that it was absolutely evident. Still, she was quick as she could be. \n\nOrdered the California omelette and it was basically scrambled eggs with chunks of avocado just tossed in there. Not well cooked and missing the bacon that's a staple of California omelettes. \n\nHash browns tasted frozen and not fresh. Blech. \n\nCoffee was also kinda burnt. \n\nWish I had a good review. They were super nice but the food leaves little to be desired. Won't be back.",0,negative
"Not impressed - food was flavorless. The set-up was cramped but cute vintage and unique. Wait staff looked run down but were nice. My corn beef hash was mushy with uncooked veggies.  The basket of muffins was okay but dry. My wife's biscuit and gravy was bland and cold, potatoes had no seasoning. We wasted $30 and the only pleasant was the wheat toast and my son's pancakes. Even the bacon was soggy and it is hard to hate bacon. We will not return.",0,negative
"Not nearly as good as the one on Boulder Hwy. Ordered a simple Bacon and Eggs and the bacon was to salty, the eggs were cold, and the toast was nearly burned. The potatoes were good and the price was great.",0,negative
"I ordered the biscuit special.  I was excited because biscuits and gravy are my favorite.  Unfortunately the restaurant does not live up to its name.  The biscuits were bland (and obviously not made from scratch as claimed), the gravy had no flavor and the eggs were oily.  Our waitress was really bad as well, so that didn't help.\n\nIf you want to have a Denny's experience",0,negative
"It was OK.\n\nMy boyfriend enjoyed his sandwich and soup, so at least there's that. I had the strawberries & cream french toast...it was pretty cold. I'd give it a second shot for the lunch fare. The location is nice and the decor was cute. The food was just nothing to write home about.",0,negative
"I came here for brunch and ordered the southern heritage. The gravy was meh, the biscuits were dry and my bacon was over cooked. I know it is a small plate place, but I would have liked a larger portion for brunch. Other than that the service was okay and the atmosphere was pretty cool. They had a DJ for brunch. What.",0,negative
"Too much food and it's not very flavorful.  I kept hearing how great the chicken & waffles were... meh\n\nFancy plating and giant portions do not make up for the lack of depth in flavor.  I know this place has many fans who will rebuke this review, however, I hate it when I pay good money and receive poor service, so-so food and walk away feeling like I can cook it better at home!  \n\nI have been there a couple of times and still don't get what all the fuss is about.",0,negative
Had the crepegg - sort of a crepe with an omelet in it. The food was ok nothing special. The coffee was ok as well. If I need to go to a breakfast chain again I think I'll chose the nearby IHOP over the good egg. The booths are massive and can easily fit six people comfortably. I didn't have the pancakes but thought it was weird that they charge extra if you want the real maple syrup.,0,negative
"Ordered the steak & eggs, with a pancake on the side. I asked for a well done steak.\n\nSteak came and was still pink and bloody inside. The eggs were not seasoned, the home fries had me wanting for more seasoning as well. Coffee is watered down and bland.\n\nWaitresses were very nice. However, even with the great waitresses you can't correct bad food. I will never go back. If you want a good breakfast spot head to eggstastic across the street - BOMB.",0,negative

I used to go here about 10 yrs ago. Had a couple of bad experiences.  Thought I'd give them another try.  Placed my order requesting to add an egg and bacon extra crisp.  Only 3 other tables seated.  Got my order..missing egg. Pancakes tasted frozen and thawed.  Took awhile to get our order.  Wanted bacon 'burnt'.  It seemed to have been microwaved.  Only thing that I ate was the milk.  Waitress appologized. She took off the bill the only thing that was good...The Milk!  No mas. Sorry.,0,negative
Horrible!! With the word 'Egg' as their business you'd figure they would know how to make medium scrambled eggs. The waffle was cold and the Ham steak was over cooked. Will not visit again.,0,negative
I ordered the country fried steak and it tasted artificial. The service was awful coffee tasted old and watery and it took forever to take our order and for them to bring our good. My boyfriend ordered the omelette fried rice it was okay. We also got the red velvet pancakes and the lemon ricotta pancakes they were good... the only thing good about this place were the pancakes.,0,negative
"How people can love this restaurant is beyond me. I've been to multiple locations and they were all disappointing. The only reason it gets two stars instead of one is because I thought their breakfast was OK.\n\nEvery time I go here I am unimpressed. My food comes out cold, overcooked and overall very bland. The only good thing are the biscuits you get to munch on beforehand. Even the cornbread tastes bland. I didn't think that was possible!\n\nBoring and bland.

"Not good. I came here for a birthday brunch and was disappointed. The menu sounded amazing, but the omelets were bland and rubbery. I had to douse my ham and cheese omelet in hot sauce and salt--something I'd rather not do. A few people in our group ordered the pancakes, which looked (and tasted) amazing. I probably won't be back, but if I returned I would be ordering the pancakes for sure.",0,negative
"Good breakfast for sure!! Buuuut the service. Omg. Terrible!! Asked 2 times for a straw, water, a spoon and fork were dirty, one of the servers petted a dog and idk if she washed her hands... Then what blew my mind was a server has a cut on their finger and blood was exposed!! Will not be going back and would not tell somebody to visit.",0,negative
"When you're in a bread company, you expect the panini (sandwiches) to be awesome. Mine was barely toasted, not cripsy. My friend's sandwich was also limp, and in addition, it was too salty. \nThe service was good and quick. The whole place was spotlessly clean. Their record from the county health dept is excellent. \nThe side salads look/taste like what you can buy at Fry's deli. Yawn....\nI would compare this to a lunch at Subway. Not bad, but not something to go out of your way for, either.",0,negative

"After hearing rave reviews, we finally went to try for first time.  Between the long wait time just to be seated, poor service, the constant waiting and having to ask for refills.  We even went to the front and asked for our check rather than continuing to wait for it.  The food was good no doubt about it, but with as much hypster hype as there has been about Matt's Big Breakfast, we expected better.  Probably wont be back....",0,negative
When I need to wait 30+ minutes for a bagel and an order of Eggs Benedict this is all I'll give in ratings. Crazy slow service from the kitchen. The fruit was not fresh and was basically made up of a banana with some nasty grapes. The Benedict was good but not exactly steaming hot according to my husband. Just skip this place.,0,negative
"I do not understand the great reviews of this place. If your namesake is \""""Biscuits\"""", maybe you should do those exceptionally well? Or at least modestly well? The biscuits were small, terrible, expensive and slow to arrive. The rest of breakfast wasn't great either. The waitress was clueless to the menu items.",0,negative
"Maybe we came in on a bad day but given their name I expected them to know how to cook their eggs. \n\nThey hard boiled my soft boiled eggs,  the over easy eggs came out with a hard yolk twice (after we sent it back). \n\nThe other fare is up to par with Denny's, but don't expect anything special",0,negative
Worst breakfast experience I've ever had. The staff was terrible. We were one of the first people there and the wait time was 45 minutes. Never stopped to refill coffee or water. The food was awful. The Tuscan toast tasted rancid. The eggs Benedict were hard boiled at best. The potatoes cold and lack luster. The whole meal should have been comped due to the horrible experience.,0,negative
Average pancake house with nothing to rave about. The eggs were good and so were the pancakes.  I would have loved to try the grits but they had none.  \n\nNothing to write home about - guess I am spoiled because we have stellar breakfast joints in suburban Chicago.,0,negative
"Slight step up from Denny's. Take it or leave it. Just don't come with high expectations. Omelet was ok, potatoes were under cooked and coffee was meh. Wife's skillet had a large black hair-she's blond.",0,negative
"I don't get all the negative reviews.  Granted, we only went once, but we feel like this is our new breakfast spot.  \n\nThe food was great.  We had the Sausage Pie, the Heavenly Hash, The Crazy Biscuits and a chocolate chip pancake - EVERYTHING was great.  Everything.  The service was great too.  Coffee and water was always refilled.  There was nothing wrong with our visit.  There was everything right.  : )\n\nWe'll be back.",1,positive
"Delicious!! Really nice waitress (dressed in PJs) and good service. I ordered a short stack with bangers and my friend got the infamous chicken and waffles. Both were great and we totally finished it all. I highly recommend their pancakes--crisp around the edges, fluffy in the middle. Thin but not too thing. Their bangers were delish too, I'm pretty sure they were in a natural casing. The chicken was tender and spiced just right.  I highly recommend this place!",1,positive
"Good friend and I swung into cute cafe, which was totally unfamiliar to me. Initial reaction is that their marketing did a great job. The second reaction is that the kitchen needs to stretch a bit. Reuben is average size but deserves a rye bread, not sweet raisin rye. Thousand island dressing was appreciated. My friend ordered two scrambled eggs; they were served dry and cold. Toast unremarkable.\n\nI did grab the nicely prepackaged sweet crisps for home munching. Pretty expensive indulgence.",0,negative
"We decided to give the griddle a try this morning as our regular breakfast joint was busier than usual. This place just doesn't do it for me. The service is rather random as any of 3-4 people bring things to your table. The food is average at best: eggs were good, bacon limp and french toast thick but not very good. The decor is also kind of random with tables on top of each other and crowded with over-sized condiments. I don't anticipate a return visit.",0,negative
"ugh...not very good.  had both breakfast and lunch on separate occasions.  sure the variety is OK and the selections unique (chocolate chip waffles!), but the quality seemed sad and lacking.  cost is SUPER CHEAP, so that is nice.  but unless I was staying here (which I was this time), I wouldn't make a special trip.  lines can be HUGE at times, which is yet another negative.  but if you like buffets, give this a go if you're in the area.  staff was excellent on both occasions, so that was nice.",0,negative
"Hmmmmmmm.  How to describe The Griddle.  A no frills, typical cafe diner with frozen/ready made chicken and potatoes, rubbery scrambled eggs, unripe fruit, and gross coffee.  But their lemon blueberry pancake was delicious.  They got an extra star for that.",0,negative
"Definitely not what its cracked up to be.  Not the worst if you have to be there for work or business, but microwaved egg scramble should not get 4 stars on Yelp.  Breakfast burrito had way too much of it in there too.  Coffee was decent.  If you don't have to be there, I would wait to get something good outside the building.",0,negative
"Horrible breakfast. Leathery eggs, razor-thin soggy bacon, COLD breakfast potatoes and only one slice of barely-singed toast. Staff was lackluster and kept forgetting items. Maybe their pizza is OK, but best avoided for breakfast.",0,negative
The service is excellent and the portions are generous but found the food very disappointing. The sauces (cheese and benedict) were too salty and tasted like chemicals rather than made from fresh ingredients. The crepes had a pastey texture and were tasteless. The bacon felt like it had been microwaved.The two little pieces of fruit on the plate were good though.\nToo many great breakfast places to enjoy to want to go back.,0,negative
"Absolutely delicious  breakfast. Had the steak and eggs, the steak was something that tasted like it came out of a mid tier steak house. I was very very impressed. The staff was warm and friendly.\n\nHowever, I guess it did take a touch too long for the food to come out since it wasn't super busy, and their bloody mary was of low quality.\n\nI left with a full heart and a full stomach though.",1,positive
"This is a review for a breakfast from March 2013. While the food (with the exception of the burnt beignets) was excellent, the service was horrible. Don't know (or care) if my waitress was having a bad day, but she was nasty! She was argumentative, wouldn't refill my coffee (although I was able to ask other servers to do so), and wouldn't clear empty plates from the table. Incredibly disappointing for a Thomas Keller restaurant. Won't be back.",0,negative
Very disappointing. This place does not live up to the hype. Very expensive for mediocre at best. Do yourself a favor and cook breakfast at home.,0,negative
"Very nice for a busy Saturday morning.  Build your own Grand slam for $6.49 is hard to beat for the portions you get.  I had 2 eggs over med, bacon, hash browns and very nice fresh pancakes.  Server was very helpful.  Service A- Food B+.  Will be back.",1,positive
"I had the chicken and biscuit with eggs. The chicken was dry, service was without a smile and the prices were high.  You basically pay for large portions without a lot flavor. I also felt guilty eating here because of the all that waste this restaurant produces.",0,negative
This place was awful. The food was subpar. We aren't that hard to please but when the food is low quality and over cooked it's a recipe for disaster. Luckily the omelette station was fresh but everything else was horrible. Save your money and go somewhere else. Even McDonalds breakfast would have been better,0,negative
"Um, I didn't get the hype of this place. I ordered their lunch special where it came with fettucine pasta and a salad. My boyfriend had the chicken waffles. I think they make the pasta themselves and it was all stuck together; when this happens, the pasta becomes undercooked in some parts (gross) and there's nothing special about the salad. My boyfriend's waffle was soggy when it should have been warm and crispy.\n\nService was good though, but the food was subpar.",0,negative
"We went there for a breakfast. This is store front in a small mall so it sets low expectation for ambiance. And it had none.\nSince the name suggested a focus on bread products, I had a croissant. It was ordinary at best (about the quality you get in a supermarket). The coffee was hot but certainly nothing special (again you get better at the Starbucks kiosk in the supermarket).\nAnd the service peaked at indifferent. The are many better breakfast places within a 2 mile radius. I will not be back at Bread and Butter.",0,negative
A huge disappointment. Paid $100 for the worst Benedict and a miserable salad bar. Will not be returning!,0,negative
"My wife and I had breakfast here this morning and was disappointed in the visit.  First cup of coffee barely hot, second was good however.  As an artificial sweeteners user we were disappointed that REAL Sweet & Low and Equal were replaced by generic ones. The pumpkin muffin was dry and my wife questioned if they are made fresh daily. Our omelet was not that hot either.  Side of two pancakes were not of uniform size and not as good as they used to be. $20 for a below average meal, not worth it.",0,negative
"Food is average at best. Customer service and choice is discouraged. Don't want a fatty potato option in your meal? Too bad, you can't substitute for something cheaper or pay for something more expensive. Never been to a breakfast place before this that didn't let you make it your way within reason.  First time here and last time here.",0,negative
Have never had a bad experience here.  Love the non traditional breakfast items. Portuguese sausage and garlic rice is awesome!! My wife had tried a different style pancake each time. .. She is never disappointed.  Highly recommend this place.!!,1,positive
"My mom didn't know this was a chain when she sat down or she would've selected someone else for me to join her and others... overall it was a 2 star experience. It took forever to get coffee and then refills and that's not acceptable in my book when in Vegas on 3 hours of sleep. \nThe french toast was fine, nothing more/nothing less. This is not a breakfast place.... I have enjoyed lunch at their Denver location.",0,negative
Great breakfast! Corned beef hash and yogurt are fantastic. Every plate we saw looked really good. Service was excellent. Steve took great care of us. I will definitely eat here again!!,1,positive
Horrible experience. Bacon...cold and old.  Pancakes dense and hard.  Potatoes deep fried and extremely salty. Please go somewhere else. Their food is NOT good.,0,negative
"BEST champagne brunch! well the only champagne brunch ive been to, but the BEST buffet! haha we happen to go during easter weekend so it was more expensive than usual ($40/person instead of $30-something) everything was really good and the champagne was delish. \n\ni definately recommend it and would go again!",1,positive
A total waste of $23 for Sunday brunch. That is what I get for being too lazy to venture farther from the conference center. The food was good but not great and there weren't many dishes to choose from. The service was just adequate.,0,negative
"if you ever need to feel like you're at your grandma's for brunch, come here.\n\nthe nice old ladies serve up decent, filling, satisfying grub that cures any type of hangover or heartbreak, whatever you suffer from. \n\nfree refills of strong black coffee, good conversations with anyone and everyone there, and homebaked cookies on the house. if you're not already stuffed. \n\n\nmust-go.",1,positive
"There will always be the image 2007, where one of my friends had to be wheelchaired out of this place because of their champagne brunch.\n\nGreat food. The service strongly depends on your server, as it can make or break you time there. Champagne brunch is the bees knees. Some of my friends managed to get a pitcher of mimosas left at the table, or have the waitress just leave the bottle.\n\nGod bless America.",1,positive
"Brunch was really good here, very tasty and healthy. Their mixed drinks were a lot of fun and inventive. We had raw oysters to start, rye toast, grilled cheese, salmon Benedict, and shrimp around the table. Everyone was happy with their food. A bit pricey though",1,positive
"Have been to Brio twice recently and enjoyed both visits. Sat outside on the patio when the weather was perfect. Drinks were average price (prosecco) and food was reasonable (half chicken with veggies). Service was fine - nothing great, nothing bad. The location is quite nice and I enjoyed the 'upscale' feel of the Piedmont Row area. \n\nI would recommend it.",1,positive
Great brunch too. Best atmosphere.,1,positive
"Love the ambiance here. Lots of natural light, open space... Went for brunch and got the mimosa. Took a while because they had to squeeze the oranges #fresh! Everything looked super yummy. I got the superfood salad which was a little heavy on the dressing, but still great. I am going to get the crab benny next time for sure. The waitress was nice, smiley, prompt, and helpful. The live music was charming.",1,positive
"This is based on sunday morning brunch.  Clutch with all you can drink beer, wine, and cider.  Real Nigiri sushi, Prime Rib, quality ingredients in all dishes, and home made Gelato.  As good as it gets for a Vegas style buffet.  Only thing is get there early because the line gets long!",1,positive
great brunch!,1,positive
"The food is not worthy the money for brunch. Very limited seafood, only small shrimp. Cost $81 for 2 people. Maybe better for dinner, or I'm not a steak/bacon/desert guy. Very long queue outside, but many empty tables inside. I believe the buffet in San Diego where I live in is with similar quality but cost only $15 per person for lunch.",0,negative
"The brunch is really nice, but going there for dinner is just not worth it. Only went because of a coupon, and I found it too old-fashioned, with sub-par food. \n\nCan't beat that donut machine for brunch though!",0,negative
Delicious dinner. Insanely good poutine! The brunch is just not my cup of tea but the dinner I would go back over and over again. French onion soup is sweet and tasty. I love this place!,1,positive
"Went twice for breakfast - much easier to get in early.  The patio seating in nice - especially for people watching, but a good meal can be had anywhere inside.\n\nThe eggs benedict and steak and eggs were huge, and the muffins are pretty tasty and filling too.  The make-your-own Bloody Mary's is a fun diversion - you're your own best or worst enemy there.\n\nFriendly hostesses and servers, lots of life and activity.  Great laid back restaurant.",1,positive
"I've been to some elaborate brunches over the years, but I think the weekend brunch here takes the cake. Over the top versions of just about anything you can imagine, from cheeses to waffles, omelets, fruits. Not cheap, but a great brunch.",1,positive
One of the best Sunday brunches in AZ. Great selection from breakfast to full carving stations. Staff is very friendly. Our waitress Suzi was awesome! I'll post pics,1,positive
"You really can't go wrong here. The brunch is amazing, and the rest of the menu is delicious. The atmosphere and waitstaff are wonderful too. It looks classy and has a neighborhood bar feel. Oh yeah, and beer, always good beer at decent prices.",1,positive
They have so much to offer.  The food and wine list are perfect for the budget.  They offer live entertainment and Brunch too!,1,positive
"I've always wanted to stop in; the spray painted sign has been piquing my interest for some time. Finally, I went for brunch yesterday, and was underwhelmed. The inside is cozy, with about 12 tables and a small bar.\n\nI had the gyros omelet, which was pretty bland and wouldn't have been edible except for the cucumber sauce. The bloody mary had so many solid spices that it was like drinking silt - kind of gross. Service was okay - they were friendly.",0,negative
The brunch was excellent. We loved the selection and the portions were large. Everything we tried was delicious!,1,positive

Everything my party of 3 tried for brunch was delicious and the service was attentive. The patio was comfortable and cool. We will be back to try out the rest of the menu!,1,positive
"Amazing bruschetta--I recommend the one with figs--and fairly priced. Good beer selection and tasty bellinis. Their meat and cheese appetizer is pricy, but so good. Cheese and cornuts! Amazing! \n\nVery accommodating on the night of my birthday, including a free dessert. I love the atmosphere and attention to detail. Even their name is stamped on their TP. That's pretty cool.\n\nI've only ever been for dinner and would definitely like to try their brunch.",1,positive
"Very tasty!  If you are in the mood for comfort food, this is the place. I enjoyed brunch there a few weeks ago with my mom. We both something sweet with a side of savory meat. I had the Johnnycakes which is like a corn pancake with prickly pear syrup. Mom had the boxty which is apple and potato pancake with mascarpone.  We were full for the entire rest of the day I believe.  So satisfying!  There weren't too many healthy things on the menu, but I don't think that's what we were looking for.  Excellent cappuccino too!",1,positive
"I've never made it to the brunch because my first two experiences at the bar were terrible. Had to send food back because it wasn't cooked properly and lacked any kind of flavor. The drinks were weak and when I asked to speak to the manager, he clearly thought I was crazy for complaining. He was confrontational, unhelpful and tried to embarrass me by saying that I was the only customer who had ever complained. . Both experiences were way below average - Plenty of Brunch options in Charlotte, I will skip Bistro La Bon.",0,negative

"We came for brunch around 1:30 p.m. on a Sunday. Man, was that a good idea! At brunch, you can get the ambiance (we sat outdoors on the patio) and great food, without paying the high price. Our table had the kobe beef burger and the french dip sandwich. Everyone raved. I'd say it was one of the better burgers I've ever had because the meat was just sooo good. I definitely recommend this place, especially for brunch or lunch. Enjoy!",1,positive

I will say our waiter was  GORGEOUS  and the piano man kept me entertained...a no go in the future.",0,negative
"Very good for Brunch. It's no L'Avenue, possibly the best brunch place Montreal has to offer, but if you're here for a few days and want some variety, I recommend you give Cafeteria a try. I had eggs over easy, potatoes, bacon, sausage and a side of potato pancakes, all tasted very good. My wife had the Monte Cristo which was pretty good. And, we shared some crepes, which were yummy.",1,positive
Best brunch ever!  You will have better luck getting seated quickly if you arrive by 10am.  They have the best potatoes in the burgh and it's good food that will stick to your ribs!  The service is always quick and friendly.,1,positive

This was my first visit in several years and we will all be going back!",1,positive

"Terrible \""""Sunday Brunch\""""!  They advertise \""""bottomless\"""" champagne Mimosa's but they pour mostly oj!  They are super stingy with refills and they ran out of 1 of the only 4 items available to eat. Would not recommend, staff is pleasant enough but brunch stinks!!",0,negative

"Sunday afternoon for \""""brunch.\"""" Too noisy to carry on any type of conversation. Slow service. My food was ordinary, and the portion looked more like a side dish. Offensively small and therefore very overpriced. I couldn't wait to get out of there. I see several good reviews, but I cannot understand what all the fuss is about.",0,negative
If you like a fancy delicious brunch def try this place.  Loved the peach Bellini and the banana pancakes (among the best ever!).  Great service and atmosphere.,1,positive
"Came here last week in the afternoon with 11 people and sat outside. The lobster croissant is definitely something you should try, gets a little messy but definitely worth it. Didnt have a bloody mary but from what I heard from my friends that they can make it really spicy",1,positive
Good brunch place but watch out for the mimosa...$10!!,1,positive
Great brunch and drinks any day of the week. Always a crowd so arrive early. Excellent service.,1,positive
"Brunch is one of the worst I have ever had in my life.  I paid $8 for a salad that I ate in 3 bites.  I am serious, and I am not a fatty.  I also ordered a mimosa, which was overly pulpy and had a bad strawberry in it, and a super bland bloody mary after telling the waiter I like a spicy bloody.  Our service was horrible too.  It was impossible to ever get our disappearing waiter to serve us.  Disappointing considering I ate dinner here like 5 years ago and it was decent.  This place is an overpriced joke.",0,negative

Lobster, lamb, rock shrimp, sushi you will want for nothing!  Champagne flows freely and it isn't cheap stuff it's Perrier Joet!  I've lived here too long to have not tried this before!  Groupon got me there, but I'll be back it's worth the price!",1,positive
"This is my new favorite for breakfast/brunch. The breads and pastries were hot out of the oven, literally, and complimented by a wonderful fig jam. Portions are large, and food is on the spicy side for me, but our waiter went out of his way to make sure my food was not over-the-top for my palette. Decor is artsy and soothing. Service is prompt, but not overly solicitous.  \n\nI'll definitely be back again.",1,positive

"Still one of the best vegan joints in town; special brunch options on weekends, though they recently changed the brunch menu and added heuvos rancheros and replaced their awesome waffles with moderately okay pancakes.\n\nIf you're going for weekend brunch make sure to go early, massive lineups after 12:30 (parking is free before 1pm also)",1,positive
"Stopped here to grab lunch and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food. We participated in the brunch menu, I had the smoked chicken salad and my husband had the steak and eggs. For dessert we shared a flourless brownie with pumpkin brittle and jalepano cranberry sauce, all delicious! Eating outside was nice to watch the birds. They had heaters going since it was a bit chilly. Also the wine and cocktail list was pretty decent selection.",1,positive
"I've only ever been here for brunch, but I've never been disappointed. The hostess is sweet and usually gets you seated right away, even if you don't have a reservation. I personally prefer coming in the warmer months so you can sit outside, but the inside is nice too.\n\nDecent bloody marys, EXCELLENT crab cake benedicts. The caramel apple french toast is pretty spectacular, too.",1,positive

"We recently went for the Sunday Brunch and it was amazing.  Everything on the help your self area was fresh and A-1, and the Chicken Fried Chicken with an egg on top was one of the more delicious things I've ever had.  Big bloody mary and champagne bar also which aren't that expensive.  Overall you'll drop a bit of cash, but its worth it.",1,positive
"I've been here twice for brunch and am in love! \n\nI had the ricotta lemon pancakes which were heavenly, light and delicious! they come covered in a blueberry coulis and come with a side of thickly cut smeared in maple bacon.

"This place is a hidden gem! I've dined there numerous times and have always been pleased with my dish and their service. I will say some of the items are pricey for the portion, so I prefer hitting their happy hour (much better prices, but also smaller menu).

"So glad BlowfishBBQ was at the Burgh Bash last week, so I was able to try the bbq chicken and the mac and cheese.  They were both on point!  The chicken was juicy and tasty!  I would love to try other things on the menu but so far with the chicken and mac, it's a 5 stars. Plus the guy who served us (not sure if it is hootie the pitmaster) at burgh bash was very nice and entertaining.",1,positive
"we rolled into town starving and the flamingo was right next door so we hit it up for the brunch menu. it's not fancy but the food was pretty good. \n\nprice is reasonable for stuffing yourself compared to other hotels, but like i said, it's not fancy. the salad bar...very good. some of the hot food...a little dried out looking. shrimp were a bit watery and soggy and crab legs req'd more work that was worth, but hey...we came in our elastic pants and left with no room to spare...so it couldn't have been that bad!",1,positive
"Came here for brunch and had a small wait. Got seated outside without being asked our preference of indoor or outdoor. As the sun moved in the summer afternoon it became quite punishing.\nThe food overall was good though. I had the mussels and my wife had the ham and cheese with the egg on top. Both dishes go to show that although simple, with high quality ingredients you can create an amazing meal. For the price, there was plenty of food so I think it has a good value.",1,positive
"Maizie's has an excellent menu, but what impressed me the most was their breakfast.\n\nVery interesting items, but what sold me where 2 things:\n\nFirst Breakfast Pizza. Sounds weird, but it was delicious and a huge portion\n\nSecond - Brunch is served late - I think like 2pm or something like that.\n\nHighly recommended",1,positive
New favorite brunch spot in Green Valley!! Brought my little boy here and he loved the bacon and eggs. My bagels and lox was delish. Sat on the patio. Great place!!,1,positive

Brunch was decent but not exciting. Shame about the pitiful service and the 35-minute wait especially when the place was less than full.,0,negative
"I've been here for breakfast/brunch.  \n\nBeing from French Canada, the whole concept of Grits is new to me.  I'm not sure i'm all about it...  I had the egg tostadas and tasted the egg enchiladas...  Everything was just alright...  Maybe I'm just not into the taste of smokey chipotle for breakfast\n\nMy favorite part of the brunch there is the variety of breads in the bread basket.",0,negative
"went for a late breakfast/brunch while we were staying at the luxor.  prices were reasonable, food was pretty good.  i had the corn beef hash and eggs, portion was good size, taste was good too.  a couple friends got pizzas which took a little longer to come, but still tasted good.  but the food seemed to be a really good meal to eat after drinking, gambling, and partying all night.  if you are down by luxor, i would recommend it for a place to stop by and try if you are hungry",1,positive
"Came here for brunch. I thought it was super overpriced at $35. Good selection, but the food was pretty average overall.",0,negative

"I'm not quite sure about  this place yet. I went for brunch on Mother's day with my parents, the atmosphere was nice, the service was attentive, but the food not that great. I had the stuffed french toast that really wasn't \""""stuffed\"""" at all it was just sliced and seasoned apples between slightly overcooked bread. I expected real maple syrup for the price of this dish, and the syrup was not real.  I think I'll give Pinot brasserie another chance someday for dinner, because brunch was definetly dissapointing.",0,negative
Terrace Cafe is wonderful place for brunch. My husband took me for my birthday brunch and we had lovely time. It was weekend so we had to wait for sometime before we got seating but trust me it was worth the wait.\nWe ate so much we could hardly move :) I guess this is best way to celebrate birthday! I loved their famous Red Velvet Waffles. Great Service and great food!,1,positive
"Nice variety of dishes-new & different things in addition to breakfast standards. Went for Sunday brunch & space is very tight which took away some from the atmosphere when you're getting bumped repeatedly. Be open to sharing a table with other guests, too--which is fine with me generally. (Ok the loud young women detailing their relationship statuses got old--much more peaceful when they left!). Would definitely eat there again though!",1,positive
"I am in love with the Roaring Fork, but only recently tried their Sunday brunch, and I have to say, it was DELICIOUS!  For only $20, you can enjoy an all you can eat buffet of some of the Fork's finest offerings, from eggs benedict, to pork and chile verde, to enchiladas, to pretty much anything else you can imagine!!  And save room for dessert, the bananas foster is heavenly!",1,positive
"Love their orangeade- so fresh and flavorful. We really wanted to try their famous sunday brunch buffet this time. Food was really good, not the best, but good quality, well stocked and clean buffet tables. There was A LOT to choose from- honorable mentions are mediterranean salad, biscuits (perfect texture and not overly salty!), broccoli casserole (yum!), fresh fruits and carrot cake. Kind of wish if they had an omelette station too ;-)",1,positive
"Went to Brio for dinner and thoroughly enjoyed the place. The house cab-merlot blend was really good and not expensive at all. We ordered the artichoke-spinach dip to start and the service was VERY fast. The dip was a very generous portion, plenty to feed 2 people. After the appetizer, we had the grilled salmon and shrimp and crab cakes, respectively. They were very flavorful and filling. Both of us were pleasantly surprised with the speed of service. I would most definitely come back to Brio.",1,positive
"Really enjoyed brunch today.  Liked the french toast with berries and creme, as well as the french toast with brie, apple and fig.  Coffee is excellent.  Service was friendly (thanks, Tuba!) and the atmosphere pleasant and comfy.  Sat and chatted for an hour after we finished and didn't feel pressured at all.  great little place.\n\nBTW, was there on a 95+ degree day and the temp inside was fine (referencing an earlier review about it being hot)",1,positive
We went to sugar factory for brunch with our groupon! I recommended you getting it saves you soo much money. We had ricardo c. as our waiter he was so great and helpful! He is the real reason why I gave 5 stars. The breakfast was delightful and the Mai Thai goblet got me feeling good! Highly recommend. I think overall was a wonderful experience. Thank you Ricardo!!,1,positive
"Brunch was very disappointing, cocktails were mediocre, and there was just no atmosphere with the total of 3 people in this restaurant. Food was just average, not worth the pain of parking at this place. Does not validate and valet is $12.",0,negative
Brunch at Eden is a real treat.  I went on a Saturday and must say I was impressed.\n\nThey have these drinks with stivia sweetener.  Get all of them.\n\nI had an Omelet and it was  well made.  I can see what people see in this place.  The food sounds more comlex then it is and really what you get is just tastey non pretentious vegetarian meal. \n\nPrices and service were both good.  Not the best ever but more then fine.  I will go back.,1,positive
"I was so hungover and thinking I won't be able to eat anything.  So wrong.\n\nIf anything all the food there was top notch.  Risotto with braised lamb was over cooked though.\n\nThe thing to look most forward to is dessert.  They had a tapioca, passionfruit/lychee jelly thing going on which made the perfect end to a great brunch.",1,positive
"Freakin' delicious.\n\nBreakfast at Bouchon is the way to go. It's cheaper than other meals, just as tasty and easy to get seated.\n\nIf the weather permits, sitting outside is the move.",1,positive
"ew. just straight ew. i'm sorry this place stinks. maybe it is the best Charlotte has to offer, but it is just gross in there.  no drinks for brunch, you have to have a drink menu if you are going to call yourself a brunch spot.  Also, fruit was blah and the hamburger was the nastiest thing i have ever eaten. fail",0,negative

"Took the family out for some pre-Mother's day celebration. Everyone wanted to try a new place for brunch so Cravings here we come. I like the food. My favorite was the dimsum, grilled fish, and omellete station. I had shrimp cocktail and snow crab legs (which was already cut in half for easy access to the crab meat). They did have a lot of dishes to choose from and I was glad we came here. The desserts awesome. Tried the peach crepe and loved the gelatos.",1,positive

"Absolutely loved this place, though I must say I've only been for brunch. The brioche is amazing and service is fantastic.if it's a nice day, sit outside. My favorite feature (and what makes it unique) is the make your own Bloody Mary. A lovely gentleman rolls up a cart and makes you the best, freshest one I've ever had.",1,positive
"This a review of the Sunday gospel brunch only. Save your $42. The food was atrocious, especially the breakfast dishes. Eggs were cold, bacon was greasy and bagels were stale. But most disappointing was the music. The gospel singers were off key during much of the numbers and were mediocre at best, plus the acoustics were terrible.",0,negative
"Good Sunday brunch! A little pricey but you get a ton of food and it's good. We enjoyed \""""the chicken and the egg skillet \"""" and the yogurt and granola parfait. The cinnamon rolls are yummy too. We also enjoyed cappuccino. They have a lovely outdoor seating area which would be great when cooler.",1,positive
"Finally got to eat brunch at the Morning Glory cafe and it was fantastic! The only downside was the cost of Bloody Mary's...$9??? That's steep. For this time of year, the setting and the weather definitely enhance the dining experience. Our waiter/host was fantastic, especially when he offered my friend a great-smelling rose. I wish I had more opportunities to make this my weekly brunch spot.",1,positive
"Brunch was mediocre. Our waiter seemed to be having a rough day or was super nervous. I couldn't even finish the quiche I ordered because it was too salty tasting, and the eggs didn't taste of terribly high quality or freshness. And then, of course, its not the most affordable thing. It took way to long to be waited on and served. \nI wouldn't go back.",0,negative
This is our favorite place for brunch! The food is very delicious. I love breakfast special #2! It feels like at grandma's home:)))),1,positive
"Had a great value, and LARGE brunch here on saturday with 3 friends. Very relaxing, great service, was a bit chilly though. \n\nCoffee needs to be a little better but apart form that I couldn't have asked for a better brunch venue.",1,positive
First of all the food was fair to mediocre ! The prime rib was so tough my knife could barely cut through it ! The gelato certainly did not taste like any good quality gelato I have ever tasted! Some of the pastries were Stale! The best thing I had here was the omlett! The Peking duck was so so. The variety of buns & dumplings was amazing but they themselves were ordinary. The short ribs were good! All drinks are not included in this hefty brunch price! So for the price this place is a NO!,0,negative
"Had an awesome brunch with the family here today.. We ordered many different dishes and everything was delicious! Simple, clean interiors, friendly service, amazing food - they got it all! Highly recommended!",1,positive
"Olive & Ivy is a great Sunday brunch spot with good service and decent menu options.  The prices are better if you leave the kids at home and the morning cocktail options are a little on the pricey side.  If you're looking for delicious cups of goodness the cinnamon roll latte is to-die-for and fantastic followed by their killer french toast!  Health nuts won't be disappointed with egg white and veggetarian options, so have no fear!  All around great brunch spot, just slightly slow on service, and a tad bit pricey.",1,positive

"BEST champagne brunch! well the only champagne brunch ive been to, but the BEST buffet! haha we happen to go during easter weekend so it was more expensive than usual ($40/person instead of $30-something) everything was really good and the champagne was delish. \n\ni definately recommend it and would go again!",1,positive
"Still one of the best vegan joints in town; special brunch options on weekends, though they recently changed the brunch menu and added heuvos rancheros and replaced their awesome waffles with moderately okay pancakes.\n\nIf you're going for weekend brunch make sure to go early, massive lineups after 12:30 (parking is free before 1pm also)",1,positive
"Awesome brunch place! Typical breakfast/brunch options. Yum food, well decorated, decent coffee too. What more could you ask for?",1,positive
"I am going to give this place 4 stars for brunch.  I had the fruit parfait, which was phenomenal and a smoothie--strawberry/banana/etc.  The service initially was spot on, but as the meal progressed and after we got our bill the waitress literally disappeared, not sure if she got off her shift??? I would def recommend this place for brunch!  Nice ambiance and cool how the food prep is out for everyone to see!",1,positive
"Long wait at 11:45 am on a Saturday, accompanied by expensive (yet terrible) food. Would never come back. Not sure why so many people are willing to wait. For god's sake, walk 10-15 minutes to Olive et Gourmando instead. Worst brunch I've had in a long time. Why is this so highly rated on Yelp!?!",0,negative
What a fun brunch! Perhaps a bit pricey but still tasty. The patio is a fun hang out spot. Fish tacos were yummy!,1,positive
"Absolutely the best brunch buffett I have ever had.  The service was perfect from the hostess to the wait staff.  The food was amaziing in selection and taste.  Lobster, lamb, rock shrimp, sushi you will want for nothing!  Champagne flows freely and it isn't cheap stuff it's Perrier Joet!  I've lived here too long to have not tried this before!  Groupon got me there, but I'll be back it's worth the price!",1,positive
"Came on a Saturday morning at 9:30am and we were seated immediately, service was very nice.  I greatly enjoyed my Brunch Des Cantons, perfectly cooked beans and various pork.  My fiance liked her Brunch Sucre, but wasn't blown away by it.  Solid Coffee and OJ included with brunch.  All in all a very pleasant experience.",1,positive
Great food and atmosphere if you can get past then incredibly rude hostess. Their brunch is a better option than their dinner.,0,negative
"Best brunch in town. Don't even waste your time and money anywhere else. We have only had dinner there once (sadly) because it was amazing! Start to finish, everything was well prepared and delicious. Top meals of of all time...worth every penny!",1,positive

"I've been to some elaborate brunches over the years, but I think the weekend brunch here takes the cake. Over the top versions of just about anything you can imagine, from cheeses to waffles, omelets, fruits. Not cheap, but a great brunch.",1,positive
"Came here for brunch, and it was pretty good!  I ordered the croque madame and it was a little bland, but mostly good.  I wish that the flavors stuck out a little, but I still managed to finish the whole thing.  I loved loved loved the french fries that came it.  Delish.  I ate every last one.\n\nI also ordered the Habiscus and bellini champagne cocktails.  When at brunch... am I right?  I liked the bellini more, but they were both pretty good breakfast drinks. :)",1,positive
I'm hooked. Go for brunch its a good deal! :),1,positive
What a gem. We had breakfast here Sunday afternoon - the daily scramble came with leeks and veggies and whipped herbed ricotta. Potatoes were fantastic and definitely try the jams. Relaxed place to have brunch.,1,positive
"This is my new favorite for breakfast/brunch. The breads and pastries were hot out of the oven, literally, and complimented by a wonderful fig jam. Portions are large, and food is on the spicy side for me, but our waiter went out of his way to make sure my food was not over-the-top for my palette. Decor is artsy and soothing. Service is prompt, but not overly solicitous.  \n\nI'll definitely be back again.",1,positive
I came here hoping to catch brunch but I guess it ends at 11:30am or 12pm. Luckily the lunch menu looked just as tasty. We ordered the Luau pulled pork sandwich (the jalapeno cole slaw gives it a nice kick) and the Monte Cristo (french toast instead of regular bread slices = delicious). Service was friendly and attentive. The dining area is decorated like a household- very comfortable and clean.,1,positive
"Brunch brunch I love brunch. Brunch at MIA yeah yeah yeah was so good yum yum. So let me tell you something, the brunch is NOT Indonesia. I know, right? So just lower that expectation. But keep it high cause its still pretty delightful. Menu features a bevy of omelettes, crepes and two types of eggs Benny. I'll be back to brunch again, 100% and definitely to try the dinner menu. See ya soooooon.",1,positive
"I went on a brunch date on a SUN around 1PM.\nI had a reservation, however I later learned that if you prefer to sit in the outdoor section to specify that clearly when making the reservation.\n\nWe were seated quickly and well attended by the waiter, Michael.  He had several suggestions and was helpful and patient as we made up our minds.\n\nThe food was good++ to excellent.\n\nAnd, for me, the sign of a good restaurant is good coffee to close the meal.\n\nI was not disappointed!\n\nRecommended.",1,positive
"I should have tried the Sunday brunch buffet months ago.  The offerings are spicier than their regular offerings.  I especially liked the chicken mole and the pozole.  They have lots of other things, including chile verde and some kind of stewed beef dish (I didn't ask because I'm allergic to beef).  And it's only $12 including a non-alcoholic beverage.",1,positive
"Once again, a place with great yelp reviews doesn't live up to the hype. I recently moved from Philadelphia, a city with great brunch spots, and  figured I would give bistro la Bon a try since it has such great reviews. I got the shrimp and grits. Hmm... Underwhelmed. This is the first time I've ever been served runny shrimp and grits, and I've had the dish in several places. I could probably whip up better shrimp and grits in my kitchen. Guess I will keep on looking for a good brunch place because this wasn't it.",0,negative
I think the Pewter Rose is a great place for brunch or anytime really. They are very consistent and that keeps me coming back year after year. I really like the vibe and the local feel the place has. Get there early on Sundays for brunch...it can get crowded quick.,1,positive

"Christmas Brunch...awsome! We went here after doing the family at home meal on Christmas Eve. It wasn't very busy which made it even better. The crepes were a huge hit at our table. I had prime rib, a custom omelet, salad with raspberries and walnuts, seafood, etc etc etc. Yes, I was stuffed after I ate as were the rest of my family. But it was so good, you hate to leave a brunch when there is good food right there. I would go back for the holiday brunch anytime. The staff was also very attentive and efficient.",1,positive

"Had my birthday breakfast here with a friend. The blueberry pancakes were delicious and the breakfast sandwich looked amazing. My friend really enjoyed it. I got the bottomless mimosas, the waitress constantly walked around with a pitcher refilling it, but they squarely aren't strong. I normally hate bloody Marys but this one was good. Ordered extra spicy. Good food good service. Definitely will come back for brunch.",1,positive

"This place is a hidden gem! I've dined there numerous times and have always been pleased with my dish and their service. I will say some of the items are pricey for the portion, so I prefer hitting their happy hour (much better prices, but also smaller menu). However, their all-you-can-eat brunch is a steal of a deal!",1,positive
"Ah....Sunday Brunch! What a spread....the salads were fresh, the pasta tasty and the meats were incredible. All along side the traditional eggs, french toast and custom omlettes. I love the horsey sauce with the prime rib. The dessert bar was SO crazy good....the creme brulee was SO good it called for seconds!\nAnd the Bloody Marys ...were to die for!",1,positive

"My favorite Sunday Brunch location. This location is always busy, so make sure you are willing to wait 10-15 mins to get your seats. \n\nBanana nut muffin is one thing you shouldn't miss, it blowed my mind the first time I tried it. It's not over-sweet and the aroma of banana smell so damn good.",1,positive

"We had a very lovely Italian brunch here, and the service was really pleasant and nice as well. \n\nWe shared two plates, one that came with some grilled bread and spreads which included a tasty burrata cheese with honey and nuts. The other was a salmon dish with a pretty ordinary arugula salad but the salmon was perfect. The space is somewhat small but very nice and quaint, perfect for a party of 2 (and some people came to brunch on their own).",1,positive

"One thing you need to know about me - I don't like Brocach. Like for real.\n\nIt's pretty boring, and feels so manufactured- maybe its the stucco on the walls, the fake irish decor, or the $6 Guinness', but I sigh every time that I get suckered into going here.

"small, intimate brunch location near the little Italy area of Montreal.  They have a small menu, but are good at what they do cook.

He got the La Florentine version, which included saut\u00e9ed spinach and chipotle in the sauce.  I had the standard breakfast with sausage.  The potatoes could have used a lot of seasoning.  The toast was good.  Our chai and cappuccinos were served lukewarm - meh.",0,negative

I had the Tres Leches French Toast and it could have came with more berries but other than that it was an excellent brunch item for sure. Some of the fluffiest bread i have ever had with French Toast in my life. Felt like i was eating a cloud.

"Always a pleasure coming here. You can order a crepe either sweet or savory. Either choice is delicious. The pastries are out of this world. My personal favorite is the fruit tart. Simple, deliciously. Simply delicious!\n\nTheir displays are always amazing and the food is fresh. Whether you order a ready made sandwich, salad, pastry, crepe, coffee or anything in between, you won't be let down.",1,positive
"I was excited to see a new crepes/waffle place opening up...to replace a crepes and waffle place!  However, after trying both crepes and waffles I remain disappointed.  The waffle I ordered was mysteriously...not hot at all.  It was topped with grainy chocolate spread.  The crepe, while hot, was a little bland and soggy.  \n\nThe ambience is nice and the La Prima coffee hit the spot, but I'd love to see improvements in the food before giving this windmill another whirl.",0,negative
"My husband and I clearly ordered incorrectly here.  We had the cheese fondue, not particularly hot or very tasty.  The salad that came with it was mediocre.  However, service was personable and the crepes did LOOK wonderful!",0,negative
"This place had escaped my attention until now, so I was very pleasantly surprised when I popped in for lunch, earlier today.\n\nOverall: \""""I was very impressed with Crolla's. The fact that lunch (soup and a filled roll) cost a total of \u00a33.70, which struck me as exceptionally good value, only served to add a cherry on the top. I'd suggest you seek it out give it a try. From now on, it'll be on my regular rotation of lunch places.\""""",1,positive

"Crepe batter seemed better suited for waffles. Fruit was fresh and tasty, icecream was ok but not blow your mind and service was friendly. Overall I would recommend if you're in the mood for a crepe or waffle with icecream and or fruit toppings, but if you are from somewhere else that had crepes of a similar style you may want to wait until you get back home.\n\nThis place was near our hotel and was worth stopping by. We had some for a late breakfast. It's not very expensive (~$6 ea) but not very filling either.",1,positive
crepes were sooooo good and yummy....my only problem s the place is sooooo small and they get pretty busy,1,positive
The most perfect croissant E-V-E-R.,1,positive
I go out of my way to eat at Crema.  Their weekend brunch specials are always appeaking and stray away from the regular pancake.eggs that other breakfast places  serve.  Also appreciate them serving and procuring local produce and meats.  Highly recommended,1,positive
"I've only ever had dessert crepes here but they were divine. Nutella, strawberries and ice cream for me please. mmmm. Their cappuccino was also quite tasty.",1,positive
AMAZING!!!!! No other crepes can beat these! The service is great. I just wish it was open longer,1,positive
"Amazing, not only do they make awesome crepes, but their other desserts just will blow you away.  You need to make sure you go and try the future of street vendors here in Phoenix",1,positive
Mother of all creperies. Service is good too. Very fresh ingredients. Lots of choices. This place is crepe heaven,1,positive
"Crepes are not the best, but they are quite good and at a reasonable price.\n\nI tried two kinds when I visited: the nutella/strawberry/banana, and the peach/almond\n\nI added condensed milk to the peach/almond. You can add extra \""""add-ons\"""" for 50 cents.",1,positive
"OK went back to grab a pastry\nIn brief, took forever to get served at the counter and the cherry croissant was raw dough in the middle, threw it away.\nWould have asked for a refund but was miles away already when I bit into it\nUGH\n\nDo not waste your money here...",0,negative
I had a salmon crepe here & it was delicious - broke me out of the habit of mostly eating dessert crepes. The only downside is that they only take cash... but there is an ATM just down the street. This is a great place to meet up with an old friend or acquaintance.,1,positive
The yummiest most delicious crepes west of the Mississippi. Fair prices too. Felt like i was in a cafe in Europe.,1,positive
"This place makes awesome Crepes!!! They sell chocolates and pastries.\n\nThey have breakfast Crepes such as their Crepe Madame with Swiss Cheese, Ham and Egg to the more traditional fruit and chocolate Crepes. Since it is within Ceasar's Palace, they are on the expensive side, $11-15 for Crepes.\n\nTheir Espresso and Coffee offering are so-so, but their Crepes more than make up for this.",1,positive
"I am a crepe fan!! And I am happy to say I have found a new breakfast favorite...you had me at cucumber water and passion fruit mimosa...but the crepes were fantastic! I even broke my rule and ate some of my BF's crepe that had chorizo and it was sublime!! If you have a vegetarian option for that crepe, I will officially camp outside your door until you open every morning!!  Thank you for the fantastic service and the amazing food! We will be back soon to try out more stuff on your menu!",1,positive
"When we came the first time we were told we would have to wait 30 min so we left. However, when we passed by 10 min later the place seemed to be working again.\n\nWe ordered 2 crepes. One was barely warm, the other was cold inside so we had to ask to make it again. To make things worse, the supposedly vegetarian tomato mozzarella crepe had pieces of ham in it!\n\nIf you want a crepe, do yourself a favor and go to Jean Philippe Patisserie in Bellagio just across the road - it's INFINITELY better!",0,negative
"This is a great place for a crepe.  I went around the corner from Pamelas, and the salmon savory crepe was very good. The atmosphere is nice.  The wait staff is helpful and cheerful.  Keep up the good work.",1,positive
"bad croissants, not to my taste... I don't understand how those can even be compared to the ones from Pain dore... not buttery, dry, not chewy....\n\ngood point: raspberry macaron cake is really good\n\nhot chocolate: worst than at Tim Horton's!!!!!",0,negative
"Note to self: NEVER order the seafood here. EVER. (One more time for effect.) EVER. \n\nIt's not fresh, smells fishy, and is gross.\n\nThe boy ordered your regular dessert-style crepe, and he said it was alright............... Maybe the next time I find myself in the Paris, I'll give it another shot.",0,negative
Might as well get your coffee and cappuccino at the gas station and pay less it's same powdered crap. Plus theso called ham in my croissant was some horrifying processed garbage w ham flavoring. Nasty but the baked goods are tasty,0,negative
"Definitely give this place a try! Even though this place is quite small, the crepes and scrumptious pastries make up for it. If this place was a little closer to where I live, I would make this place a weekly morning visit for a joyful cup of coffee along with a try on each pastry. I do look forward to see more options to be added along with the crepe variety. This place also makes cakes for those special occasions. Will try the cake selections next time an occasion comes up.",1,positive
"Oh mylanta. I think I just got dia-beetuz!!! The crepes were delish, just what I needed on a 105 degree day. Well... kind of.",1,positive
"Best crepes I have ever had, by far. I got the one that was full of chili - I think it was called the Oh La La. The portions are fairly big, and come with a salad made from fresh greens on the side. Service is great here too!",1,positive
"After a cold hike around Old Montreal, we stopped in to the bustling Creperie Chez Suzette. We had just had lunch, so we got dessert here. We ordered what is called the symphony crepe. It was a giant crepe filled with blueberries, strawberries, bananas, orange slices and grapes. Soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo good! Check it out when you are in the Old Montreal area.",1,positive
"Ew. I am just judging one crepe (the vegetarian mushroom one with b\u00e9chamel) but it was really, really bad. Not worth the line!",0,negative
Pretty tasty and the guys were very helpful!  we had bananas foster crepe and the triple berry crepe.  Yum!!!,1,positive
"Delicious! I had a wonderful crepe with banana and nutella; the husband had a breakfast crepe with ham and cheddar cheese. Light and delicious, completely satisfying. It was so nice to have a delicious, quick bite that didn't cost an arm and a leg. I would go back again in a heartbeat.",1,positive
"These crepes are not crap.\n\nI tried the banana chocolate crepe and it was perfectly warm and delicious. I don't usually like fruit in my crepes (I like them strictly filled with sugars devoid of any redeeming qualities), but the combination they served up was just right!\n\nThere's a lot of space, so you can chill with your homies for a while, which is nice.\n\nAlso tried the croissants: not bad, but I would more likely go back from crepes as the name suggests.",1,positive
"I ordered a mixed berry crepe here the other day while I was at the Bellagio. Disappointing, I thought, as it tasted like an ordinary plain crepe with pre-mixed fruit. And I paid ~$10 for this! La Creperie over at Paris is a much better place for crepes.",0,negative
The best crepe in town!!!\n\nEven though the sign on the DOOR does not make sense but I still gave 5 stars.\n\nThe sign told us to get to the DOOR to get the table. We were in front of the door and noone help us. Until we figured out that we had to actually go through the DOOR to get inside to get the table.,1,positive
"Yeah croque madame on WHEAT BREAD, that took 45 minutes to come out, at least I Love Genie, was on the TV.",0,negative
Crepes are pricey and super bland not savory at all...,0,negative
Had a really basic UNDERwhelming crepe here... The crepe itself was made badly and it was filled with defrosted soggy old strawberrys... They tried to hide the old fruit with GLOBS of Nutella... \n\nBarf... i was really annoyed and threw it away.\n\nREALLLY THOUGH... You dont have the decency to have Fresh Strawberrys??,0,negative
"Lean, elegant and tasty food. It has a little bit of everything; breakfast, lunch and sweets. The crepes are made to perfection and the price is reasonable. The size of the crepes is just right too. I had the maple dream and my boyfriend had the Americana for breakfast, I would recommend both to anyone.",1,positive
"This place was pretty bad. We got the nutella, fruits du mer, peanut butter & bananas, and the mixed berry crepes. The only one that was good was the peanut butter. I think a lot had to do the poor quality of the ingredients. Would not go back.",0,negative
The croissants tasted weird. I should have went back to get my money back but didnt want to miss my flight.,0,negative
If i had to choose a place for dessert crepe..i'd choose you jean philippe ! the nutella one is my fav...we also ordered chocolate..which was good but not as amazing as nutella cause you know i loveee nutella!,1,positive
Dessert crepes.  A very pleasant change for dessert.   The fruit is fresh and the crepes and waffles are good.   Waffles still tasty if you bring them home.  The waffles are best eaten fresh.  All crepes and waffles come with ice-cream.,1,positive
"Still haven't tried the crepes and the scones look AMAZING.\nHowever, I'm a purist about coffee. \nThese people know what they're doing. \nKickapoo is a great roast to start. \nThen, they take care to measure and grind to the specific pour process. \nThe result is a balanced, caramel, sweet; yet punchy cup of glory.\nBoom.",1,positive
"Crepes?! Really?! My savory \""""crepe\"""" was more like a burrito... Chipotle size and evrything. The photos here are exactly what one would expect, but NO, its a big burrito stuffed. I had high hopes and was extremely disappointed. I gave two stars beause taste was ok, but not a crepe (you couldnt even taste the crepe dough itself). If I were the owner I would definitely teach my employees what a crepe should look/taste like... Or change the name and pictures shown here.",0,negative
"Found these two (thanks to twitter) at the Tet Festival in Mesa. I tried the banana, mango, vanilla cream and crushed meringue crepe. It was unbelievable. Fantastic flavor and texture on a perfectly made crepe. \n\nDelicious food from a sweet couple.. I will be watching their twitter feed tor more locations (hopefully soon!).\n\nYum!",1,positive
"The ham and cheese croissant sandwich was a great on-the-go breakfast. Despite the line/ crowd, everyone was pleasant and orderly, and made crepes, coffees, and sandwiches with efficiency and ease. It's nice to know that my croissant sandwich was made fresh instead of just extracted from the display case and heated up. Definitely recommended for a quick pick-me-up.",1,positive
"Came back to La Petite France twice after my initial visit, and both times were for crepes. I'm giving it one more star just for the delicious savory and dessert crepes!  Although service is consistently slow (compare to many other restaurants), I kinda respect it now that they are French, and why rush when you have the time to enjoy a nice meal :) So if you are busy with a limited time for a meal, just don't even bother to come!",1,positive
"2 flaky croissants that tasted very good. Staff was very friendly. \nThey don't take credit card, but they open at 7AM",1,positive
I love crepes and this is a good place to get your crepe fix. Their Crepe menu is pretty big and you will definitely find something to your liking. \n\nI came here on a Sunday and luckily I made it before the rush came in. Once the rush was in around 12p there was a wait averaging 10-15 minutes. This wait can be eternity especially after a good night out in the city. \n\nI would definitely come back and maybe next time try a sweet Crepe,1,positive
"This crepes are wonderful and  delicious.   We had The Rosarito,  The Monterey and a side of bacon.   The service was good... Pretty cool thing you can do is  watch them prepare you crepes on a tv screen mounted above the griddle... If time permits I'm sure the wife will be dragging me back here everytime were in town..",1,positive
Crepes are overpriced and disgusting.  It was like $9 for a crepe that was filled with nothing.  Service was non-existant.,0,negative
"Delicious! I love the dessert crepes, I could probably eat all of them in one sitting. Today I ordered the Strawberry Nutella crepe and it is to die for. Just the right amount of cream, nutella, and strawberries to make the crepe a delicious treat instead of a sugar overload. I will say that the service is not the best. The lady who served us (I'm pretty sure the restaurant owner) was not friendly towards my table at all and no one greeted us as we came in or left.",1,positive
"Do you like crepes? If so look no further...these are sumptuous! We tried the Suzette which is orange segments, cointreau, brown sugar, butter and lemon juice...mmmm.......and the Napoleon which is lemon custard with raspberries, blueberries and strawberries....wow! Accompany that with the Irish Coffee and it is an almost spiritual experience. They make the crepes right in front of you and you are given them to go. You can take them back to your room or you can enjoy them right there. Highly recommend!",1,positive
How dare they not put cheese on my croissan'wich?,0,negative
I love this place!! We got the Nutella Crepe with 2 scoops of ice-cream (pistachio+ vanilla) and was sooo good.,1,positive
"Had a savory crepe and wished I had gone for a sweet dessert crepe option. The crepe was underwhelming and dry, barely recognized it as a crepe.  However I also tried the dark chocolate mousse cake which was delicious.",0,negative
"I bought the Toulouse crepe, which reminded of a pizza before eating. The crepe looked delicious and was freshly made. The Fresh basil on top was a nice touch  The mariana sauce was cold when they put it on top of the crepe so it ruined the entire dish. :( This also made the cheese clump together faster, making it more dissatisfying by the bite. It had so much potential!!! I'm disappointed.",0,negative
Great espresso drinks and delicious fresh Crepes.,1,positive
"This is a quick spot for breakfast and very good. A litle overpriced, $9.99 for a crepe and $3.50 for a regular coffee!! However, the crepes were freshly made and delicious. I had a ham crepe with bechamel sauce which was very tasty and my man had something that resembled pizza, a sausage and mushroom stuffed crepe covered in marinara sauce. We went back another day and he had the the seafood crepe which was filled with shrimp. Both were very good.",1,positive
"The croissants were amazing!\nFood was good, and I liked the choice of Mimosa flavors.",1,positive
"After wondering in NoDa area, which is really smaller than expected, I walked in this famous restaurant, and had a piece of creamy cheese croissant and queshi, they are so yummy.

Went on Saturday and WOW what amazing crepes!!  Shared an Italy and an Austria and the quality was simply outstanding!  Service was great as well.  The only negative is the fact that they don't do tap water and charge 1.50 for bottled water.  It seems to me that if they were really sorry about that they would charge something closer to cost for people dining there.,1,positive
We got a Nutella brioche and bananas foster crepe. Totally disappointed very expensive and not tasty at all!!!\nGo to Max Brennar at caesar's palace!,0,negative
The Crepes were defiantly worth the long line!! The deserts were very good too!! The fresh orange juice was good too! The chocolate fountain was smaller then expected. And you can watch them make the crepes. Was def worth the time and the trip!,1,positive

"came here on 8/7/2011 and had a wonderful crepe with avocado and chicken. The staff was friendly and helpful with my order. we would return the next time we visit Montreal. My husband ordered a crepe with asparagus and ham, he loved it.",1,positive
Worst crepes I've had. Dessert crepes were cold and rubbery. Definitely not fresh. The ice cream had a bad taste. I would never eat here again.,0,negative
"We stopped by this Boulangerie Premiere Moisson for breakfast.\n\nA friend picked up a box of sweets she had ordered, and got me a plain croissant. (She offered to buy a chocolate one, but it's tough to take sweets early in the morning. Really. Don't read into that.)\n\nMy croissant was delicious: Fresh, flaky, and all-around tasty.",1,positive
"They changed the fricken recipes! the crepes used to be much better until the menu change after October 2012.\n\nMy favorite crepe used to be the apple crepe and they used to caramelize the apples and it would be warm. Now they have raw, sour, cold granny smith apples with the skins still on smothered in some cold caramel sauce. i guess they changed it because its quicker and cheaper.I actually returned the crepe and told them the new menu change sucks. Why do places always have to mess with a good thing?",0,negative
"Their filled croissants are awesome! The only reason I can't give 5 stars is because they are out of croissants about half the time I go there. I appreciate that they might run out by later in the day, but not at 10am on a regular Saturday. Anyway, I've had several varieties of their filled croissants and find them to be super delicious and yummy.  Be sure to go early for best selection!",1,positive
"Thanks for a great brunch, Donna. The veggie crepe and banana nut muffin were yum!\n\nMy husband had the works crepe and he said it was really good.",1,positive
First of all Try the Nutella crepe!!! The BLT crepe is great too! The owners are very kind. The only disadvantage to coming here is the service is very slow. Sometimes you will be waiting for someone to come great you for about 10 minutes.,1,positive

"I tried their version of a Cronut and was not impressed. It tasted like a Churro, but at $5 each, it was not worth it. the dough was not buttery or flaky like a croissant, but really oily like a Churro.  When I chewed it, I could taste the oil seeping out of the dough. Creating an after taste and running the cinnamon flavor. At $5 per (imitation) Cronut (or whatever it is they call it... The whole thing was a rip off.",0,negative
"My favorite place for crepes! I've been going since a couple of years back when they first opened. Authentic crispy thin crepes with innovative toppings. There isn't much option on the menu but it seems just enough to satisfy my cravings - a little bit of every breakfast option from cereal to scones to egg crepes. It's getting a big too crowded for me on the weekends but I'm glad Tempe has come to discover it's neighborhood gem. Great food, great people, great business.",1,positive
Disappointing.  The savory crepes I was looking forward to was dry and chewy.  My wife's was same dry crepe and way too sweet.  At least the frappe wasn't bad.,0,negative
"say \""""au revoir\"""" to this place...don't ask me how to pronounce it.  please excuse my french, but the crepes here are f*cking nasty!!!  seriously, they are on a verge of becoming pancakes.  i wouldn't even give them to my enemies (thanks to the geneva conventions treaties), not that i have any...\nthis is one of those places that falls into \""""what happens in vegas stays in vegas\""""!",0,negative

No. Crepe for you....\n\nFirst of all the crepe nazi that owes the place is rude and should not have a public facing job. \n\nSecond the service is awful and the crepes were like rubber.\n\nDon't bother making the drive to Henderson to eat here!,0,negative
Not all the crepes are good!\n\nJust because you didnt like the crepe you had doesnt mean there is nothing good on the menu! I tried the seafood crepe and berry crepe and didnt care for either.

Great find. The breakfast crepe was delicious. They serve a very large portion for a great price.  We also tried the sweet cinnamon swirl and lemon zest after... So delicious.

"Overpriced and horrible.  Was hankering for a Crepe Suzette so I stopped by Paris Crepe on Rue St. Catherine for one. What appeared before me, however, was not Crepe Suzette.

The only positive thing I can say is that this place is one of the less expensive options for breakfast. I ordered the Napoleon and I could have made a better crepe myself - and I'm not even a good cook! It was made with frozen berries that tasted like rubber. Will not be coming back here. Le Village Buffet right across from La Creperie must have a long line for a reason.,0,negative
"It takes forever to get served.  It is a chain -- so the dishes aren't awesome.  Seems the sweet crepes are better (or at least look better) than the savory ones, we did not stick around to find out.  The savory crepes though... First of all, they don't taste so good.  The crepes are soggy, the chicken is a bit dry and the cream sauce put us in the bathroom for 2 days.  So, I would say never again",0,negative

There are good crepes and there are bad crepes... This place definitely has the good kind!! I took mine to go and when I got to my room it was still PERFECT! I really also love their coffee. Just the regular ol' coffee is delicious! Kind of a nutty flavor almost.. :],1,positive
"Note to self: NEVER order the seafood here. EVER. (One more time for effect.) EVER. \n\nIt's not fresh, smells fishy, and is gross.\n\nThe boy ordered your regular dessert-style crepe, and he said it was alright............... Maybe the next time I find myself in the Paris, I'll give it another shot.",0,negative
"Finally I found a very good,delicious crepes in town....went to Suzuya last Saturday try the blueberry cream cheese & strawberry shortcake ohhhh tastes like heaven.....:):):)this is going to be my special treat for myself every time I come to Suzuya......love it!!!!!",1,positive
"Thank you for the wonderful crepes. They were the last meal we at on our trip to Montr\u00e9al. Absolutely fabulous. Large. Great salad. Great dressing. Just enough syrup, meat, and cheese. My favorite was how the brie, cheddar, and goat cheese all complimented each other with the smokey ham which was chopped just perfectly.\n\nGreat surroundings, too. Perfect location. Walking distance from Notre Dame.\n\nThey advertise wifi, but we weren't able to find the network.",1,positive
"Pretty good crepes, and great location. The crepes however weren't too amazing. The ingredients tasted like quality, but for the price I expected a lot better. The buckwheat flour they used though is pretty cool though.",1,positive
"Okay, they have the cronuts. But it was so greasy that I was unable to finish it. Bummer.",0,negative
"Definitely give this place a try! Even though this place is quite small, the crepes and scrumptious pastries make up for it. If this place was a little closer to where I live, I would make this place a weekly morning visit for a joyful cup of coffee along with a try on each pastry. I do look forward to see more options to be added along with the crepe variety. This place also makes cakes for those special occasions. Will try the cake selections next time an occasion comes up.",1,positive
"Best crepe I have ever had beside the Vietnamese style that my mom makes.  Love this place the service and the decors, it's a little smokey due to the place is small.  Great brunch!",1,positive
This one star does not shine that bright for the turkey spinach crepe I had here last weekend.  Quite disappointing. Too thick. Looked and tasted mass produced.  I mean cubed flavorless turkey meat and mushy spinach.  Can they really stamp this with the Jean Philippe brand?,0,negative
"The Nutella crepe and chocolate crepe were just like the ones we had in Paris.  The bacon, egg, and cheese crepe (not available in France) really hit the spot for breakfast.  The incredible cakes on display and the world's largest chocolate fountain were amazing - if only we could taste them.  \""""I love crepes...\""""",1,positive
"I was excited to see a new crepes/waffle place opening up...to replace a crepes and waffle place!  However, after trying both crepes and waffles I remain disappointed.  The waffle I ordered was mysteriously...not hot at all.  It was topped with grainy chocolate spread.  The crepe, while hot, was a little bland and soggy.  \n\nThe ambience is nice and the La Prima coffee hit the spot, but I'd love to see improvements in the food before giving this windmill another whirl.",0,negative
"I was craving something sweet so my daughter and I opted for a crepe. Now I wasn't expecting anything super exceptional. The crepe was ok and in the end a little too sweet but then again that was my fault because I ordered something with apples, whipped cream, and ice cream. I had to tell the cook to go easy on the ice cream. Customer service was substandard but then again what do I expect? Not many options at the Fashion Show Mall Food Court to choose from any way. Overall not my cup of tea.",0,negative
"Waited 35 minutes for a crepe. Not impressed with savory crepes. Seemed unorganized, but servers were friendly.",0,negative
We got a Nutella brioche and bananas foster crepe. Totally disappointed very expensive and not tasty at all!!!\nGo to Max Brennar at caesar's palace!,0,negative
Great espresso drinks and delicious fresh Crepes.,1,positive
"OH MY GOD! \n\nI had the Croissant Sandwich (the freshest croissant I have ever had). My friend got the Egg white with tomato/avocado Omelette. Super fresh, super good. We shared an order of the French Toast with blueberries & whipped cream - absolutely to die for! The most delicious French Toast I have had....hands down. Service was great too.",1,positive
"I got one of the crepes here and was somewhat disappointed. Well the fruit in the feeling was fresh and Nutella is always good, the pancake itself was too thick and tough. I can't see myself spending $7 or $8 on another one of these\n\nPS they are very large so I recommend splitting it with someone if you choose to spend your money.",0,negative
"Overpriced and horrible.  Was hankering for a Crepe Suzette so I stopped by Paris Crepe on Rue St. Catherine for one. What appeared before me, however, was not Crepe Suzette. It was this thick, doughy buckwheat crepe that had orange marmalade smeared on top plus a small dusting of confectioners' sugar. Really?? That for $11 + tip??",0,negative
"The chocolate croissant was delicious! Flaky melt in your mouth goodness, they bake croissants daily and the one that I had bought was fresh out of the oven. I also ordered a cannoli. These were piped when ordered. The cannoli was crispy but the filling had an orange zest which I didn't care for. The tiramisu cup was very light, creamy and just yummy, but again there was the orange zest that I didn't care for. Overall, this place was delicious and I will return for more treats.",1,positive
"Crepes are delicious, fresh, and worth the wait! Seating is a little cramped, but there are not too many other options in such a small space.",1,positive
"I am a crepe fan!! And I am happy to say I have found a new breakfast favorite...you had me at cucumber water and passion fruit mimosa...but the crepes were fantastic! I even broke my rule and ate some of my BF's crepe that had chorizo and it was sublime!! If you have a vegetarian option for that crepe, I will officially camp outside your door until you open every morning!!  Thank you for the fantastic service and the amazing food! We will be back soon to try out more stuff on your menu!",1,positive
Not all the crepes are good!\n\nJust because you didnt like the crepe you had doesnt mean there is nothing good on the menu! I tried the seafood crepe and berry crepe and didnt care for either. Now that i know what i like i never order anything but the Apple or pear crepe. We usually order 2 crepes and 2 Baileys coffees with the bill being $30. We dont care because its a treat that we only get maybe twice a year!,1,positive
"Not bad. Although I didn't try their hot crepe, but I did love their dessert strawberry crepe. Probably one of the best one i had so far..",1,positive

"Do you like crepes? If so look no further...these are sumptuous! We tried the Suzette which is orange segments, cointreau, brown sugar, butter and lemon juice...mmmm.......and the Napoleon which is lemon custard with raspberries, blueberries and strawberries....wow! Accompany that with the Irish Coffee and it is an almost spiritual experience. They make the crepes right in front of you and you are given them to go. You can take them back to your room or you can enjoy them right there. Highly recommend!",1,positive
"Last year my boss got boxes of croissants from here.  The different kinds were distinguished by a different symbols made in icing on top of the pastries.  I was hoping for a pan au chocolat, but the closest they had was chocolate chip (my boss got every flavor).  The croissants were decent, but there was nothing particularly special about them.",0,negative
Best crepes on the strip.,1,positive
Mmmm tasty croissant right out of the ice box and directly into my bag.  I love paying $2.50 for over priced cold hard bread.  \n\nKeep up the good work!,0,negative
Delicious crepes! I always get the ones with berries and am never disappointed. Way better than the crepe I had last night at Jean Phillipe's Pattiserie at Aria.,1,positive
"Definitely Not the best place for completely overpriced crepes but it served me well when i needed one after a particularly heavy nite of drinking. It was pretty much the only restaurant opened that wasn't creepy or gross on Crescent\n\nI like the savory (beef, mushroom, cheese) crepe better than the other 2 we had (strawberry ricotta and banana nutella)\n\nThe crepe itself is very mediocre. I'm not sure they know how to make a crepe...it was just a thin doughy thing that held the rest of the stuffing inside.",0,negative
